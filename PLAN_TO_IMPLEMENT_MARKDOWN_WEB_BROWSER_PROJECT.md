# PLAN_TO_IMPLEMENT_MARKDOWN_WEB_BROWSER_PROJECT.md

> Goal: Build a "markdown web browser" that renders any URL in a headless Chromium, captures the fully laid-out page as images, sends those images to an OCR-to-Markdown model (olmOCR via remote API or local), and shows the resulting Markdown (raw and rendered). Optimized for agent consumption, reproducibility, longevity, and caching.

---

## 0. Philosophy & Key Decisions

- **Screenshot-first, PDF-never by default.** Capture the exact pixels that end users see (no print CSS, no pagination artifacts). PDF capture stays opt-in for archival workflows only.
- **Tiled capture at model-native resolution.** olmOCR’s model card is clearest when the longest side is ~1288 px. We tile long pages into overlapping images at this size, then down/up-scale as needed.
- **Deterministic, inspectable pipeline.** Every run emits `artifact/` (PNGs), `out.md`, `manifest.json` (UA, viewport, scroll policy, capture code versions), and `links.json` (DOM-extracted anchors/forms).
- **Agent-friendly extras.** Beyond Markdown we export a structured JSON index of links, headings, tables, and artifact paths so agents without vision can act immediately.
- **Local-first dev, remote-first inference.** MVP leans on the public olmOCR inference server; we progressively add official local GPU inference for privacy and throughput.
- **2025Q4 upgrade focus.** We now maintain a living “incremental upgrade” addendum (Section 19) that captures the highest-ROI improvements such as Chrome for Testing pinning, pyvips tiling, HTMX SSE, sqlite-vec indexing, and olmOCR-2 FP8 defaults.

## 1. Target Stack

### 1.1 Backend
- **Language/Runtime:** Python 3.13
- **Env/Packaging:** `uv` + `pyproject.toml` (strict hashes, lockfile) with `--python 3.13`
- **Web framework:** FastAPI (ASGI)
- **ASGI servers:** Uvicorn by default; Granian optional for higher-throughput deployments (see Section 19.8.1)
- **Browser automation:** Playwright (Chromium channel pinned to Chrome for Testing) with persistent profiles per user
- **Image processing:** Pillow for edge formats + libvips (`pyvips`) for fast resizes/tiling/PNG encode tuning
- **Job orchestration:** asyncio task graph (MVP) → optional move to `Arq`/`RQ` later
- **Cache/Store:** Content-addressed filesystem layout, Git LFS optional; metadata in SQLite/SQLModel + sqlite-vec for semantic retrieval (Section 19.6)
- **Auth/Keys:** `.env` via `python-decouple` (olmOCR API key), optional OAuth for authenticated browsing profiles later

### 1.2 Frontend
- Static HTML served by FastAPI
- Alpine.js for state + HTMX for declarative swaps/streaming
- Tailwind CSS for layout
- Lucide SVG icons (vanilla SVGs to keep stack light)
- Client Markdown render via `markdown-it` (server prerender via `md4c`/`mistune` optional)
- highlight.js for code blocks
- HTMX SSE extension once Section 19.7.1 lands

### 1.3 OCR/VLM
- Primary: Remote olmOCR (`olmOCR-2-7B-1025`), now defaulting to FP8 variant for throughput
- Optional: Local inference using the official toolkit on vLLM/SGLang, exposed via the same HTTP client interface
- Model policies encoded in `models.yaml` (long side target, prompt template, FP8 preference, concurrency caps)

```

Key flows:
1. User enters a URL and `POST /jobs` creates a job while SSE immediately streams state updates.
2. Playwright (CfT build) renders the page, executes the scroll policy, hides distractions, and captures deterministic viewport sweeps instead of brittle `full_page` shots.
3. Tile Builder slices/rescales to 1288-long-side tiles with ≈120 px overlap, recording offsets, SHA256, CfT version, and screenshot-style hashes.
4. OCR Client submits tiles concurrently with back-pressure to remote FP8 endpoints or local toolkit adapters, using retries and policy-driven concurrency caps.
5. Stitcher merges Markdown segments, normalizes headings via DOM cues, fixes hyphenation, and appends provenance comments plus the DOM-derived Links Appendix.
6. Viewer/CLI surfaces rendered vs raw Markdown, artifacts, links JSON, manifest, embeddings search, and live events for agents.

Key signals:
- Capture + OCR progress via SSE (`/jobs/{id}/stream`) and JSONLines feed (`/jobs/{id}/events`).
- Content store keeps tiles, manifests, embeddings, link tables, provenance metadata.

---

## 3. Detailed Pipeline

- **Bootstrap:** Launch headless Chromium pinned to a Chrome-for-Testing build and record both `cft_version` and Playwright version in `manifest.json`.
- **Transport selection:** Default to CDP for CfT Chromium; fall back to **WebDriver BiDi** whenever CDP parity lags (e.g., cross-browser replay, non-Chromium agents, or CfT regressions). Record the active transport in `manifest.browser_transport` and include it in benchmark/run reports.
- **Context:** `viewport=1280×2000`, `deviceScaleFactor=2`, `colorScheme="light"`, `locale="en-US"`, reduced motion, screenshot `animations="disabled"`, and init scripts masking `navigator.webdriver`. Prefer Playwright’s built-in screenshot options (masking, CSS scaling) over bespoke CSS.
- **Version guard:** Require Playwright ≥1.50 so we inherit the built-in animation disabling, `expect(page).toHaveScreenshot()` stability, and locator `hasNot*` filters that keep the viewport sweep deterministic. Capture the exact version in `manifest.playwright_version`.
- **Screenshot config:** Set global defaults in `playwright.config.(ts|mjs)` (`use.viewport=1280×2000`, `deviceScaleFactor=2`, `colorScheme="light"`, `reducedMotion="reduce"`, screenshot `{ animations:"disabled", caret:"hide", maskColor:"#fff", timeout:15000 }`). The capture runtime mirrors these values via `app/settings.py`, and `scripts/run_checks.sh` + Playwright smoke specs always import the shared config. Prefer locator/page `toHaveScreenshot` assertions with CSS mask lists over bespoke sleep/scroll hacks.
- **Navigation:** `page.goto(url, wait_until="networkidle")` with a firm timeout and cleanup of long-lived sockets.
- **Scroll policy:** Deterministic viewport sweep that scrolls ≈1000 px per step, waits 300–350 ms, caps at 200 steps, and stops once scrollHeight stabilizes twice; uses `IntersectionObserver` sentinels plus SPA height-shrink retries (Section 19.2.4).
- **Stability pass:** Inject selector blocklist CSS via Playwright’s screenshot `style` option to hide cookie banners/sticky headers, pause/mute media, and enforce `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce`.
- **Playwright screenshot APIs:** Lean on `expect(page).toHaveScreenshot()` / `expect(locator).toHaveScreenshot()` for smoke tests and capture assertions so animation freezing, masking, and CSS scaling stay centralized in upstream Playwright code.
- **DOM harvest:** Capture `anchors`, `forms`, `headings`, and `meta` data (title, canonical, og:url, lang, timestamps) into `links.json` so the Links Appendix and agents can mirror the live DOM.

_2025-11-08 — RedBear (bd-0o0) opened a bead to land the shared Playwright config + CDP/BiDi transport fallback so §§3.1–3.4 match AGENTS.md defaults._
_2025-11-08 — RedBear (bd-x6v) is tracking the content-addressed cache reuse/dedup work from §3.5/§19.6 so repeated captures actually hit the cache._

### 3.2 Tiling & Resizing
- Prefer viewport-sized sweeps over `full_page=True`; if a monolithic bitmap is needed, slice it into vertical strips (~1400 px) with **≈120 px overlap**.
- Downscale/upscale so the longest side is ≤1288 px (policy-controlled), preserving aspect ratio; record original offsets, scale factors, DPI, CfT version, screenshot-style hash, and per-tile `sha256` for reproducibility.
- Use pyvips for slicing/resizing/PNG encode (`Q=9`, palette off, non-interlaced) and fall back to Pillow only for exotic formats; optionally run background `oxipng` to shrink cached artifacts without delaying OCR.

### 3.3 OCR Submission
- **Concurrency:** Start with 4–8 in-flight requests and auto-tune toward `min(8, cpu_count)` based on recent p95 latency and 5xx rate; expose "throttle to N" events in the UI.
- **Retries:** Exponential backoff with jitter, 2–3 attempts for 5xx/timeouts; partial Markdown pages stream as soon as each tile succeeds.
- **API contract:** Configurable base URL, API key header, model name—responses contain Markdown text per tile plus optional token usage metadata.
- **Local fast path:** When `OCR_LOCAL_URL` is set, point the same client at vLLM/SGLang toolkit servers (Section 19.1.2) without changing HTTP semantics.
- **Cost/latency budget:** Track per-tile estimates from previous runs and surface them in the manifest/status bar for better ETA and spend projections.

### 3.4 Markdown Stitching
- Concatenate tile Markdown with deterministic boundary markers `\n\n<!-- tile:{i} offset:{y} -->\n\n`, upgrading to `source:` comments per Section 19.4.3.
- Trim duplicate fragments in overlaps by fuzzy matching the last N lines of tile *i* with the first N lines of tile *i+1*, assisted by SSIM on the ≈120 px overlap strips.
- Normalize heading levels using the DOM heading outline so `DOM: h2 -> OCR: ####` becomes a canonical H2 while preserving the original text in an HTML comment for provenance.
- Merge tables that span tiles only when header rows repeat and overlap SSIM stays high; otherwise keep them separate to avoid over-merging.
- Apply conservative hyphenation fixes (`word-\nbreaks` → `wordbreaks`) when the next line begins with lowercase characters.
- Append a **Links Appendix** grouping anchors by domain with `[text](href)` entries, forms summary, and `meta` block sourced from `links.json`.

### 3.5 Caching & Reproducibility
- **Directory layout:** `cache/{host}/{path_slug}/{yyyy-mm-dd_HHMMSS}/` with `artifact/full.png` (optional), `artifact/tiles/tile_{index:04d}.png`, `out.md`, `links.json`, `manifest.json`.
- **Database:** `runs.db` (SQLite/SQLModel/sqlite-vec) stores `runs(id, url, started_at, finished_at, status, cache_path, sha256_full, tiles, ocr_provider, model)` plus `links(run_id, href, text, rel, type)` and section embedding vectors.
- **Git/LFS (optional):** Commit Markdown outputs, store heavy artifacts via LFS so CI can diff Markdown over time.
- **Content addressing:** Key caches by `(normalized_url, cft_version, viewport, deviceScaleFactor, model_name, model_rev)` to prevent mismatches when browsers or models change.
_2025-11-08 — RedBear (bd-x6v) wired in the content-addressed cache reuse flow: `/jobs` computes the key up front (respecting per-request viewport overrides), manifests carry `cache_hit/cache_key`, cache-hit snapshots now include artifact metadata, `mdwb fetch` reuses by default (`--no-cache` overrides), and JobManager emits cache-hit events so SSE/UI/CLI reflect when artifacts were replayed._
- _2025-11-08 — PinkCreek (bd-ug0) added `scripts/check_env.py` so CI/smoke jobs can fail fast when `.env` is incomplete (API_BASE_URL, CfT pin, olmOCR endpoints, concurrency caps). OrangeMountain (bd-tt4) added pytest coverage for the helper (`tests/test_check_env.py`) covering both human and JSON output._

## 4. API Surface

### 4.1 Core Endpoints
> _Status 2025-11-08 — BlackPond (bd-3px) implemented the `/jobs` REST + SSE contract: job creation, polling, `/jobs/{id}/stream`, artifact routes, and `/jobs/{id}/embeddings/search` are now live against the FastAPI app/stores._
- `POST /jobs` → `{id}`
  - Body: `{url, profile_id?, capture_mode:"screenshot"|"pdf"|"auto", ocr:{provider, model}, viewport?, scroll?, reduce_motion?, local_ocr?:bool}`
- `GET /jobs/{id}` → job snapshot
- `GET /jobs/{id}/stream` → SSE stream (HTMX-ready)
- `GET /jobs/{id}/events` → JSONLines feed for agents/CLI tailing
- `GET /jobs/{id}/result.md` → final Markdown
- `GET /jobs/{id}/links.json` → anchors/forms/headings/meta
- `GET /jobs/{id}/artifact/{name}` → images/PDF
- `POST /jobs/{id}/webhooks` → register callback URLs (defaults to DONE/FAILED notifications)
- `DELETE /jobs/{id}/webhooks` → remove callbacks by id or URL (mirrors CLI helpers; see Section 9)
- `POST /replay` → re-run with same manifest but different OCR/tiling policy

_2025-11-08 — FuchsiaPond (bd: markdown_web_browser-t82) implemented real `POST /jobs` + `GET /jobs/{id}` routes via the new JobManager, so capture requests now persist manifests/tiles in `Store` and expose snapshots for the UI. SSE + events remain on the roadmap._
_2025-11-08 — JobManager now drives `/jobs/{id}/stream`, so the HTMX SSE endpoint emits live snapshot JSON (state, progress, manifest path) instead of the demo feed; `/jobs/{id}/events` now serves newline-delimited snapshots for CLI/agent consumption. The UI Events tab tails the same feed, and `scripts/mdwb_cli.py` exposes real `stream`/`events` commands for job monitoring._
_2025-11-08 — RedBear (bd-9ke) implemented the real `/replay` endpoint + event logging so CLI/ops tooling can resubmit manifests per §§4.1/9.1._

### 4.2 Job States
1. `BROWSER_STARTING`
2. `NAVIGATING`
3. `SCROLLING`
4. `CAPTURING`
5. `TILING`
6. `OCR_SUBMITTING`
7. `OCR_WAITING`
8. `STITCHING`
9. `DONE` | `FAILED`

Each state carries timestamps, counters (tiles done/total), errors, CfT version, and concurrency throttle notes.

---

## 5. Frontend UX

- **Top bar:** Back/Forward, URL field, search, Go, profile chooser, capture mode, OCR policy dropdown (`olmOCR-2-7B-1025-FP8` default), local/remote toggle.
- **Main pane tabs:** Rendered Markdown | Raw Markdown | Artifacts | Links | Manifest | Embeddings (new) | Events tail.
  - Rendered Markdown: sanitized HTML preview with DOM-guided heading normalization; suspicious spans show DOM patch hints.
  - Raw Markdown: `<pre>`/Monaco with copy/export buttons.
  - Artifacts: tile gallery + highlight toggles (tile id, y-offset, SHA, scale).
  - Links: domain-grouped table with quality badges (DOM vs OCR coverage, target rel attributes).
  - Manifest: JSON viewer with CfT/Playwright versions, screenshot style hash, long-side px, model revision, concurrency autopilot data.
  - Embeddings: SQLite-vec powered section search + "jump to tile" action.
  - Events: SSE log mirrored in HTMX.
- **Bottom status bar:** Live state, tile progress, concurrency autopilot notes, warnings (canvas-heavy tile, overlay blocklist, FP8 preference), SSE health indicator.
- **Keyboard & accessibility:** Global shortcuts (`g` to focus URL, `cmd/ctrl+enter` to run, `[`/`]` to swap tiles) plus ARIA landmarks around tabs ensure agents or screen readers can follow streaming updates; status bar exposes polite live regions for SSE text.
- **Microcopy & cues:** Each card shows whether content came from OCR vs DOM patching (badge: “DOM assist”), tile cards include provenance hover showing `tile_i`, `offset`, `sha256`, and CfT version; manifest tab highlights mismatches (e.g., CfT drift) in amber to prompt re-run.
- **Link actions:** Table rows have inline buttons for “Open in new job”, “Copy anchor Markdown”, and “Mark as crawled”. When the DOM vs OCR delta exceeds a threshold the row gets a warning icon that links to artifact preview anchored to the tile range.

_2025-11-08 — PurpleDog (bd-rje) wired the HTMX/Alpine shell to the live `/jobs` API: the toolbar now POSTs `/jobs`, stores the returned job id, and points the SSE/links panels at `/jobs/{id}` endpoints with demo fallbacks only when a job id isn’t supplied._

_2025-11-08 — SSE bridge now driven by `web/app.js` EventSource client + `/jobs/demo/stream` manifest events so UI can render live state/progress/runtime/log placeholders before the real `/jobs/{id}/stream` exists._

_2025-11-08 — Demo stream extended with rendered/raw Markdown, artifacts list, and links table events so all tabs can exercise the data contract ahead of bd-3px._

_2025-11-08 — Started bd-ogf scaffolding: `app/dom_links.py` placeholder for DOM harvest + hybrid overlay plus `/jobs/demo/links.json` sample endpoint to unblock Links tab + agent testing._

_2025-11-08 — UI shell can now target arbitrary `/jobs/{id}/stream` endpoints via Job ID selector + EventSource reconnect logic; Links tab also offers a manual refresh that hits `/jobs/{id}/links.json` for testing ahead of real data._

_2025-11-08 — Hardened bd-rje scaffolding: FastAPI now serves `/` + `/static` via absolute paths, artifact list rendering avoids `innerHTML`, and the Run button clearly states that job submission is still stubbed._

_2025-11-08 — `app/dom_links.py` now defines LinkRecord merge/serialization helpers; demo SSE + `/jobs/demo/links.json` pull from this shared logic so backend/UI stay in sync for Link delta contracts._

_2025-11-08 — Added BeautifulSoup-powered DOM snapshot parsing so `extract_links_from_dom()` can return real anchors/forms once capture snapshots land._

_2025-11-08 — FuchsiaMountain (bd-co1) hardened the live monitoring surfaces: the UI Events tab now consumes `/jobs/{id}/events` via a streaming NDJSON reader (heartbeat/health badges + reconnect cues), the Manifest tab surfaces sweep stats + validation alerts pulled from the stream, and the Links/Manifest panels auto-refresh whenever a job transitions into a terminal state._

_2025-11-08 — RedBear (bd-2p3) opened to deliver the missing Links tab actions, per-domain grouping, and DOM-vs-OCR badges promised in §5._
_2025-11-09 — RedDog (bd-2p3) kicking off the LinkRecord metadata uplift + domain-grouped Links tab with inline actions (open job, copy Markdown, mark crawled) and DOM/OCR badges._
_2025-11-09 — RedDog (bd-2p3) shipped LinkRecord metadata (rel/target/kind/domain), domain-grouped Links tab UI with badges + action buttons, persisted “mark crawled” state, and README notes covering the new workflow._

## 6. Error Handling & Resilience

- Network idle that never resolves → fallback to `domcontentloaded` plus extra wait; record detour in manifest.
- Canvas/WebGL-first content → emit warning banner + attach raw tile thumbnail next to Markdown block.
- Anti-automation overlays → blocklist injection + UI toggle for per-domain overrides.
_2025-11-08 — BrownStone (bd-dm9) introduced JSON-backed selector blocklist + capture warnings; manifests now log `blocklist_hits` + warning codes for SSE/UI surfacing. PinkCreek added `scripts/mdwb_cli.py demo` helpers so the CLI can render these warnings/links using the shared `.env` config._
- Scroll shrink / poor overlap → capture now emits `scroll-shrink` and `overlap-low` warnings whenever viewport sweeps retry due to shrinking SPAs or overlap match ratios fall below the configured threshold (defaults: 1 shrink event, 0.65 ratio). _2025-11-08 — BrownStone (bd-dm9)._
_2025-11-08 — WhiteSnow (bd-dm9) added sweep stats + `validation_failures` to CaptureManifest and the ops warning log so retries and duplicate seams show up even when no DOM warnings fire._
_2025-11-08 — WhiteSnow (bd-dm9) updated the web UI manifest tab to render blocklist hits, sweep stats, and validation failures, and the SSE event feed now emits dedicated blocklist/sweep/validation events so the Events tab/CLI watchers stay in sync._
_2025-11-08 — LilacSnow (bd-dm9) synced the public `ManifestMetadata` schema/docs/tests with the capture dataclass so sweep stats, overlap ratios, and validation failures flow through APIs, CLI output, and manifests without ad-hoc parsing, persisted those fields to SQLite via RunRecord, surfaced them through `mdwb jobs show` (new sweep/validation rows) + warning log JSON output, and mirrored the same breadcrumbs in `scripts/show_latest_smoke.py` so nightly smoke manifests highlight seam regressions immediately._
- Server overload → adaptive OCR concurrency, queue visibility, remote/local failover.
- Partial results → stream partial Markdown as tiles finish; mark sections as incomplete with provenance comments.
- Full-page retries → viewport sweep restarts when shrink detected; record both sweeps.
- Lazy-load deadlocks → Instrument the scroll policy to detect when `IntersectionObserver` stops firing despite new requests; escalate to a “force flush” mode that triggers manual `scrollTo` bursts and logs `scroll_height_stuck` in the manifest for later triage.
- OCR flake classification → Tag retries as `timeout`, `5xx`, `throttle`, or `quality_guard`; persist counters per job so ops can spot systemic issues (e.g., remote endpoint throttling) without combing logs.
- Artifact corruption → Validate tile SHA256 before submit and after OCR response; auto-delete/re-shoot corrupted tiles while keeping the previous attempt zipped for debugging.
- _2025-11-08 — BrownStone (bd-dm9) now logs warning/blocklist incidents to `ops/warnings.jsonl` automatically (configurable via `WARNING_LOG_PATH`)._
- _2025-11-08 — BlueCreek (bd-bo2) is wiring the existing `JobManager` event log into `/jobs/{id}/events`, adding heartbeats, and keeping the NDJSON feed tailing future updates so CLI/agents can rely on a continuous history._
- _2025-11-08 — BlueCreek (bd-adg) fixed `/jobs/{id}/events` sequence cursors so NDJSON tailers only receive new entries (no more replay loops) and exposed the underlying `get_events(..., min_sequence=…)` filter for API/CLI consumers._
- _2025-11-08 — BlueCreek (bd-qx0) persisted webhook registrations via `Store` + added `GET /jobs/{id}/webhooks`, so webhook listings survive process restarts and operators can inspect registrations via API._
- _2025-11-08 — BlueCreek (bd-bba) implemented the hosted olmOCR client (`app/ocr_client.py`), sending base64 tiles to the configured `OLMOCR_SERVER`/`OLMOCR_MODEL` endpoint via httpx with response normalization + tests so capture jobs can hook into real OCR results._

---

## 7. Security & Privacy

- Remote OCR bright banner + manifest flag.
- Key storage server-side only; never leak to client.
- Artifacts stored locally with optional auto-purge TTL per workspace.
- Chromium runs with hardened flags; per-user persistent profiles supported but opt-in.
- TLS baseline: terminate HTTPS at the FastAPI/ASGI edge with automatic certificate rotation; include CfT version, commit SHA, and job UUID in structured logs for forensic stitching.
- Data retention policy: artifacts default to 30-day retention with per-workspace override; manifest records `purge_at` so downstream agents know when cache entries expire.
- Red/blue profile separation: authenticated browsing profiles live under user-specific directories with OS-level sandboxing; jobs referencing profiles inherit that isolation and record it in `manifest.profile_id`.

_2025-11-08 — RedBear (bd-cls) opened a bead to wire `profile_id` through the API/capture stack and add the retention metadata promised above._
_2025-11-08 — RedBear (bd-cls) wired profile_id through JobManager/capture/store, persisting storage state under `.cache/profiles/<id>` and recording the id in manifests + RunRecord._

---

## 8. Performance Budget

- Tile resolution ≤ 1288 longest side (policy-driven).
- Concurrent OCR requests start at 6, auto-tune toward `min(8, cpu_count)` based on p95 and 5xx rate.
- **Latency targets (p95):**
  - Short page (<5 tiles): ≤8 s end-to-end
  - Medium article (5–15 tiles): ≤25 s
  - Long dashboard (>15 tiles): ≤45 s
  Alert when capture_ms + ocr_ms breaches these budgets twice in 30 min.
- Cache hits show prior Markdown instantly; invalidated by content hash change or CfT/model mismatch.
- HTTP/2 enabled in httpx, gzip Markdown responses, persistent connections.
- Capture telemetry: record `capture_ms`, `tiling_ms`, `ocr_ms`, `stitch_ms`, `links_ms` per job and publish a weekly export so you can spot regressions tied to CfT or model upgrades.
- Throughput budgeting: each queue worker advertises `tiles/sec` based on last 15 minutes; dispatcher uses that to decide when to spawn additional workers or redirect to local inference.
- Artifact size guardrails: track PNG mean/95th percentile sizes per domain; warn when compression drifts, which often signals overlay injections or CSS loops inflating DOM height.

## 9. CLI & Agent Interfaces

### 9.1 CLI
```
mdwb fetch https://example.com \
  --out out.md \
  --tiles 1288 --overlap 120 \
  --concurrency 6 \
  --ocr.server $OLMOCR_URL --ocr.key $OLMOCR_KEY --ocr.model olmOCR-2-7B-1025-FP8
```

_2025-11-08 — PurpleDog (bd-dwf) added the initial Typer/Rich CLI scaffold (`scripts/mdwb_cli.py`) with demo `snapshot/links/stream/watch/events/warnings` commands powered by the `/jobs/demo/*` endpoints (including `--json`/`--raw` output + manifest warning/blocklist rendering), `mdwb dom links` for offline DOM snapshot parsing, and the first real `/jobs` commands (`mdwb fetch/show/stream/watch`) wired to the JobManager SSE feed / polling API (fetch supports `--watch`) while `mdwb watch` falls back to polling until `/jobs/{id}/events` lands._
_2025-11-08 — BlueCreek (bd-e1x) fixed the `mdwb images` workflow so it no longer references `files` before assignment; the command now validates directories up front, short-circuits when empty, and reuses the computed manifest for preconvert/resume._

_2025-11-08 — RunPaths now tracks `dom_snapshot_path` and the capture pipeline writes each job’s DOM HTML plus extracted `links.json` to disk (`Store.write_dom_snapshot` + `write_links`), with `GET /jobs/{job_id}/links.json` + `mdwb dom links --job-id …` surfacing the data._

_2025-11-08 — BrownStone (bd-dm9) added `mdwb warnings tail` to read the new warning/blocklist JSONL log (`WARNING_LOG_PATH`)._

_2025-11-08 — BrownStone (bd-dm9) expanded the manifest + `/jobs` schema so blocklist hits and structured capture warnings flow through snapshots/SSE; demo endpoints + UI now render the warning pills, paving the way for real `/jobs` events once 3px is wired._

_2025-11-08 — FuchsiaMountain (bd-rn4) imported the upstream “Automated olmOCR CLI Tool Documentation” into `docs/olmocr_cli_tool_documentation.md` and copied the CUDA 12.6 bootstrap helper to `scripts/setup_olmocr_cuda12.sh` so GPU runners can follow the same setup before using the CLI._

_2025-11-08 — WhiteSnow (bd-y5b) hardened `scripts/olmocr_cli.py` optional handling + type hints so `uvx ty check` stays green after importing the upstream CLI helpers (detected server/model flags + stdout filtering)._

_2025-11-08 — WhiteSnow (bd-dwf/kxv/xf0) added `mdwb warnings tail` + richer event logging, `mdwb jobs webhooks list/add/delete`, `mdwb fetch --webhook-url …`, and `mdwb jobs artifacts manifest|markdown|links` so agents can manage callbacks and download artifacts entirely via the CLI._
_2025-11-08 — LilacSnow (bd-h4i) added `mdwb jobs bundle` (aliasing the artifacts helper) so ops can fetch `bundle.tar.zst` without remembering the longer subcommand; README/docs/ops/gallery now document the workflow._
_2025-11-08 — Follow-up (GreenPond, bd-kxv docs) documented the new `mdwb fetch --webhook-url/--webhook-event` flags and the CLI’s non-zero exit codes/`--json` output for webhook deletion so automation scripts know how to wire the flow end-to-end. Tests: `tests/test_mdwb_cli_fetch.py`, `tests/test_mdwb_cli_webhooks.py`._

### 9.2 Agent JSON Contract
```
POST /jobs { url, options }
→ { id }
GET  /jobs/{id}/status
→ { state, progress:{done,total}, links_uri, markdown_uri, artifacts:[...], embeddings:{db, section_ids} }
```

### 9.3 Event Stream
_2025-11-08 — OrangeMountain (bd-3px/dwf) wired a persistent event log so `/jobs/{id}/events?since=<iso>` serves NDJSON snapshots and `/jobs/{id}/webhooks` registers signed callbacks (header `X-MDWB-Signature`). `scripts/mdwb_cli.py watch` streams the live NDJSON feed (with `--since/--follow` cursors) and falls back to SSE when the endpoint is unavailable; `mdwb events` outputs raw NDJSON for automation. The CLI now enforces required `.env` keys (`API_BASE_URL`, `OLMOCR_SERVER`, `OLMOCR_MODEL`, `OLMOCR_API_KEY`) via `_required_config()`, so ops get an immediate failure instead of silent defaults._
_2025-11-08 — mdwb fetch gained `--webhook-url`/`--webhook-event` so operators can register callbacks as soon as a job is created; the CLI reuses `/jobs/{id}/webhooks` for each URL and reports failures inline. PinkCat (bd-kxv) added argument validation/tests so `--webhook-event` cannot be used without `--webhook-url` and the helper remains covered by pytest._
_2025-11-08 — PinkCat (bd-tda) landed the initial replay helper, and PinkDog (bd-tda follow-up) reorganized it under `mdwb jobs replay manifest <manifest.json>` with Typer subgrouping, HTTP/2 toggles, `--json` output, and expanded pytest coverage so `/replay` flows no longer depend on the legacy shell script._
_2025-11-08 — PinkDog (bd-vnx) added the missing `mdwb jobs embeddings search` CLI command so ops/agents can hit `/jobs/{id}/embeddings/search` directly (supports inline or file-based vectors, `--top-k`, and `--json` output)._
_2025-11-08 — PinkDog (bd-w66) implemented `mdwb watch --on EVENT=COMMAND` (also available via `fetch --watch`) so lightweight automation can react to `snapshot`, `state:DONE`, or other custom events with shell hooks (commands receive `MDWB_EVENT_*` env vars)._
_2025-11-08 — Added pytest coverage (`tests/test_mdwb_cli_events.py`) for the CLI event-tail helpers so `_iter_event_lines`, `_watch_job_events_pretty`, and `_cursor_from_line` keep working as the NDJSON feed evolves._
_2025-11-08 — PurpleHill (bd-1gi) finished migrating the remaining event/watch/replay/demo commands onto `_client_ctx` (including the NDJSON cursor helper) so all mdwb CLI HTTP calls close their clients deterministically; ruff/ty/pytest ran clean after the change._
_2025-11-08 — PurpleHill (follow-up) fixed `_client_ctx` so explicit `timeout=None` values now propagate to httpx (restoring the infinite-timeout behavior required by SSE/NDJSON streams) and hardened the agent starter CLI helpers to verify capture job IDs before polling._
_2025-11-08 — PinkCat (bd-t46) refreshed README + docs/ops to document the new diag/watch hook/artifact/replay/embeddings commands so ops/onboarding have a single CLI reference._
_2025-11-08 — PinkCat (bd-mux) added `SKIP_LIBVIPS_CHECK=1` to `scripts/run_checks.sh` so targeted CLI/unit runs can bypass the libvips preflight on hosts without the system dependency while keeping the default fail-fast behavior._
_2025-11-08 — PinkLake (bd-4dq) added `mdwb fetch --resume`, which reads `work_index_list.csv.zst` + `done_flags/` (configurable via `--resume-root/--resume-index/--resume-done-dir`) before contacting `/jobs`; completed URLs are skipped with a progress summary, README/docs now cover the flags, and `tests/test_mdwb_cli_fetch.py` gained coverage for skip/submit/marking flows. The CLI auto-enables `--watch` for resume runs so successful jobs write the corresponding `done_*.flag` + index entry, keeping future retries deterministic._
_2025-11-08 — PinkLake (bd-4dq follow-up) added `mdwb resume status` so agents can inspect resume roots (counts, sample entries, JSON output) without spelunking `done_flags/`; tests now cover both full index and hash-only states, the CLI watch/fetch flows now show tile percent + ETA (toggle via `--no-progress`), and `--reuse-session` lets fetch/watch reuse one HTTP/2 client so TLS/H2 negotiation isn’t repeated for the streaming phase._
_2025-11-08 — RedSnow (bd-oez) fixed `mdwb resume status` to list only completed entries (previously showed every backlog entry) and added unit tests covering the filtered output + ResumeManager helpers._
_2025-11-08 — RedSnow (bd-742) extended `mdwb resume status` with `--pending/--no-pending` plus JSON fields (`completed_entries`, `pending_entries`) so ops tooling can see outstanding URLs in both text and machine-readable form._
_2025-11-09 — RedMountain (bd-co1 sweep) taught `mdwb resume status` to surface orphan `done_flags` explicitly (JSON fields + CLI warning) and record their copies under `done_flags_review/`, so ops know when manual review is required instead of silently accumulating drift._
_2025-11-09 — RedMountain (bd-co1 sweep) fixed `mdwb watch --raw` so `--on` hooks still fire (previously the raw branch skipped `_trigger_event_hooks` entirely); new regression tests cover the behavior._
_2025-11-08 — RedSnow (bd-dex) added `--out` support to the new agent starter scripts (summaries + TODOs) so automations can persist results; README/docs stayed in sync and pytest now covers the new flag._
_2025-11-08 — RedSnow (bd-3aa) added the original `MDWB_RUN_E2E=1` toggle to `scripts/run_checks.sh` so teams could optionally run `tests/test_e2e_cli.py` after the standard pytest subset; this now serves as the lightweight sentinel suite with the new `MDWB_RUN_E2E_RICH` flag driving the FlowLogger scenarios._
_2025-11-08 — RedSnow (bd-5q6) documented the rich CLI FlowLogger output + toggle usage in README/docs/ops so ops/CI knew how to capture the panels/logs when the suite ran; those docs now point at `MDWB_RUN_E2E_RICH` following the bd-rlp changes._
_2025-11-08 — RedSnow (bd-4zy) expanded ops pytest coverage (update_smoke_pointers env/root behavior, show_latest_smoke failure/JSON paths, check_metrics console timing) and wired the new tests into `scripts/run_checks.sh` so ops tooling regressions surface in CI. WhiteDog followed up with additional show_latest_smoke JSON-pointer tests + check_metrics summary assertions and synced README/docs accordingly._
_2025-11-08 — WhiteDog (bd-4zy follow-up) added missing pointer/weekly JSON tests for `scripts/show_latest_smoke.py`, ensured `README.md`/`docs/ops.md` describe the new `--json` outputs and pytest summary artifacts emitted by `scripts/run_checks.sh`, and added JSON-summary coverage to `tests/test_check_metrics.py` so `total_duration_ms` matches per-target timings._
_2025-11-09 — GreenLake (bd-4zy) hardened `scripts/show_latest_smoke.py` so blank `latest.txt` pointers now fail fast, added seam-marker + pointer tests, and updated `scripts/check_metrics.py` + tests so `--check-weekly --json` always emits a `weekly` block (status/summary_path/failures) even when the summary cannot be read; README/docs/ops capture the new guardrails._
_2025-11-08 — PinkLake (bd-4dq) added optional session reuse to the mdwb CLI (`--reuse-session`) and wired the agent starter scripts to reuse a single HTTP client by default so submit/poll/fetch no longer renegotiate TLS/H2 for every phase._
- SSE: `event:state`, `event:tile`, `event:warning`
- JSONLines: newline-delimited objects mirroring SSE for CLI `--follow`

### 9.4 Agent Hooks & Webhooks
- `/jobs/{id}/webhook` registration lets external agents receive signed POST callbacks on state transitions (same payload as SSE events) so automation pipelines do not need to poll.
- `/jobs/events/subscribe` returns an API key-scoped cursor for bulk consumption; agents can request `filter=warnings` to only receive anomaly events (canvas, overlay, retry spree).
- CLI supports `mdwb watch <id> --on tile 'echo "tile done"'` for quick local automation, mirroring the webhook payloads.
_2025-11-08 — BlueHill (bd-0q7/848/woz/lud/9qo/tcf) fixed duplicate DELETE `/jobs/{id}/webhooks` handlers, added CLI helpers for list/add/delete (all supporting `--json` plus consistent error exits), and layered FastAPI regression tests covering success + 400/404/422 error paths so webhook management stays reliable._
_2025-11-08 — PinkCat (bd-us8) refactored the CLI webhook delete flow into a helper, surfaced the request payload in `--json` output, and expanded pytest coverage (id vs url + error cases) so `mdwb jobs webhooks delete` matches the Plan §9 contract._

_2025-11-08 — PinkCat (bd-bs0) began drafting the missing `README.md` + quickstart guide so new agents can rely on the layout’s promised entry instead of digging through the entire Plan; the initial version now documents prerequisites, CfT pinning, uv setup, CLI usage, and required tests._

```

_2025-11-08 — PinkCat (bd-37t.1) migrated the packaging snippet + repo to uv dependency groups; `uv pip compile pyproject.toml` now runs clean without the deprecated `tool.uv.dev-dependencies` warning._

Observability extras wire FastAPI + Uvicorn/Granian metrics into Prometheus via `prometheus-client` and optionally export richer traces to OTLP backends; `structlog` keeps JSON logs consistent with the manifest metadata fields.

## 12. Minimal `.env.example`

## 14. Test Plan

_2025-11-08 — PinkCreek (bd-ug0) owning ops/test instrumentation: codifying ruff/ty/Playwright automation + nightly smoke + weekly latency scripts before wiring dashboards and CLI docs._
_2025-11-08 — PinkCat (bd-tt4) adding pytest coverage for `scripts/check_env.py` (required/optional sets + human/JSON output) so env validation stays stable when config inputs change._
_2025-11-08 — PinkCat (bd-8pt) added a libvips/pyvips preflight to `scripts/run_checks.sh` so missing system deps surface immediately instead of crashing pytest with `libvips.so` errors._
_2025-11-08 — RedSnow (bd-ug0.1) aligning the mdwb_cli test stubs with the `_client()` http2/timeout contract so `SKIP_LIBVIPS_CHECK=1 bash scripts/run_checks.sh` can go green again; coordinating with the bd-1gi reservations before landing the fixes + updated status note._
_2025-11-08 — WhiteDog (bd-ptest-cli) added pytest coverage for `mdwb stream`, the `_iter_sse`/`_stream_job` helpers, `mdwb demo snapshot/links`, the diag manifest-fallback error path, and the warnings CLI missing-log path (tests/test_mdwb_cli_events.py, tests/test_mdwb_cli_show.py, tests/test_mdwb_cli_diag.py, tests/test_mdwb_cli_warnings.py) so every Typer command listed in §14.1 stays under run_checks without relying on the live API._
_2025-11-08 — WhiteDog (bd-ptest-cli) also added regression coverage for the new pytest summary helper (`tests/test_report_pytest_summary.py`) so run_checks’ JUnit/JSON artifacts stay reliable._
_2025-11-08 — WhiteDog (bd-ptest-reporting) taught `scripts/run_checks.sh` to emit a reusable pytest JUnit + JSON summary (`tmp/pytest_report.xml`, `tmp/pytest_summary.json`) via `scripts/report_pytest_summary.py`, so CI/Agent Mail can reference failing test names without re-running the suite._
_2025-11-08 — ChartreuseCastle (bd-ptest-prom/bd-ptest-store/bd-ptest-ops) stacked persistence + ops coverage: `tests/test_store_manifest.py` and `tests/test_manifest_contract.py` now assert RunRecord sweep/timing/validation metadata, `tests/test_check_metrics.py` exercises the Prometheus health-check CLI (API base/exporter overrides, JSON summaries, trailing slashes), and `scripts/run_checks.sh`’s target list now includes the smoke pointer helpers (`tests/test_show_latest_smoke.py`, `tests/test_update_smoke_pointers.py`) plus the new Prom/store suites while deduplicating the e2e hook. README + docs/ops note the expanded coverage and pytest summary artifacts._

- **Golden pages:** static docs, sticky headers, SPAs with virtualized lists, huge tables, canvas charts.
- **Assertions:** headings preserved, no duplicate sections at seams, DOM vs OCR link delta < 10%, tables recognized, provenance comments present.
- **Perf:** p50/p95 timings, retries ≤2 per tile, memory footprint below threshold on 10k px pages.
- **New guards:** CfT pinning test, viewport sweep regression (full-page omission repro), table split fuzzer, scroll stabilization harness.
- **Generative E2E guardrail:** every major feature must have at least one GenIA-E2ETest (or comparable LLM-generated) scenario that exercises scrolling, tiling, OCR, stitching, and manifest logging end-to-end. Keep fixtures for these tests under `tests/test_e2e_generated.py` and fail CI when the Markdown diff exceeds 2%.
- **Rich-logged integration suites (§14.2):** add `tests/test_e2e_cli.py` scenarios that exercise CLI + agent workflows with `rich` panels/tables/syntax highlighting so each step logs inputs, invoked helpers, and outputs (see §14.2 for logging primitives, scenario list, and automation requirements). Hook these suites into `scripts/run_checks.sh` (behind `MDWB_CHECK_METRICS` or a similar env toggle) so ops can chase regressions with the same annotated breadcrumbs they’d expect in production.

_2025-11-08 — RedBear (bd-hki) opened a bead for the missing GenIA guardrail suite (`tests/test_e2e_generated.py`) + run_checks toggle mentioned above._

### 14.1 Pytest Coverage Checklist

All new or modified subsystems must be accompanied by targeted pytest modules so regressions surface quickly. When in doubt, follow this baseline matrix:

| Area | Example Tests | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Capture helpers | `tests/test_capture_warnings.py`, `tests/test_tiling.py` | Mock pyvips/Playwright as needed; validate warnings, seam ratios, checksum enforcement. |
| Store & manifests | `tests/test_store_manifest.py`, `tests/test_manifest_contract.py` | Ensure RunRecord metadata (timings, sweep stats, validation counts) persists and matches schema contracts. |
| CLI commands | `tests/test_mdwb_cli_*.py` | Use `CliRunner` + stub clients to cover every Typer command (artifacts, replay, resume, warnings, resume status, ocr metrics). Include JSON output assertions when supported. |
| Agent helpers | `tests/test_agent_scripts.py` | Exercise the shared capture/resume utilities powering `scripts/agents/…`. |
| Prometheus tooling | `tests/test_check_metrics.py` | Verify structured JSON output (status/ok/fail counts/total_duration_ms) and exporter overrides for the metrics health check. |
| Ops scripts | `tests/test_show_latest_smoke.py`, `tests/test_update_smoke_pointers.py` | Ensure smoke manifests/summaries render overlap/validation breadcrumbs and pointer files are validated. |

When adding code to these areas:
1. Create or extend the matching pytest module (mirroring the filename pattern above).
2. Add lightweight fixtures/stubs instead of hitting real services (use `CliRunner`, `httpx.MockTransport`, or local file roots).
3. Update `scripts/run_checks.sh` to include any new test modules if they exercise core tooling (CLI, ops scripts, agent helpers).
4. Run `uv run pytest ...` locally before requesting review, and capture the command/output in your Agent Mail bead summary.

#### Bead Breakdown (Pytest Coverage Upgrades)
- **bd-ptest-core** — Audit existing pytest modules against the checklist, file gaps per area (capture/store/CLI/agents/ops), and prepare a punch list for follow-up beads.
- **bd-ptest-cli** — Add or extend CLI-focused pytest modules (mdwb_cli commands, resume helpers, warning log JSON). Ensure `scripts/run_checks.sh` references the added tests.
- _2025-11-08 — LilacSnow expanded `tests/test_mdwb_cli_resume.py` + `tests/test_mdwb_cli_warnings.py` so `mdwb resume status` (JSON + text) and the warning log table/JSON paths stay covered; `scripts/run_checks.sh` now exercises these cases._
- **bd-ptest-store** — Cover persistence/datastructure changes (RunRecord, manifest schema) via `tests/test_store_manifest.py` + contract tests; include fixture helpers for future contributors.
- **bd-ptest-ops** — Expand ops script coverage (show_latest_smoke, update_smoke_pointers, agent starter scripts) and document how to run them locally (README/docs/ops cross-links).
- **bd-ptest-prom** — Keep `tests/test_check_metrics.py` aligned with telemetry changes (flags, JSON output, exporter overrides) and tie the bead to PLAN §20 telemetry requirements.
- **bd-ptest-reporting** — Add a CI summary step (or ensure Agent Mail templates) that links to pytest logs / coverage deltas whenever run_checks fails, so operators know which area regressed.

### 14.2 Rich-Logged CLI + Agent Integration Suites

_2025-11-09 — PurpleBear (bd-rle/bd-rlc/bd-rlp) added this section to formalize the “rich-logged” CLI/agent scenarios so test artifacts mirror the ops dashboards._

**Logging primitives (enforced per scenario)**
- Use a dedicated `rich.console.Console(record=True, width=120)` fixture so pytest can assert on `console.export_text()`/`export_html()` while still streaming to stdout during local runs.
- Wrap every phase (`Step 1 — Inputs`, `Step 2 — Invocation`, `Step 3 — Results`) in `rich.panel.Panel.fit(...)` blocks. Inputs must highlight the CLI command/kwargs with `rich.syntax.Syntax` (language=`bash` for CLI, `python` for Typer helpers) so reviewers see the exact invocation.
- Summarize intermediate artifacts via `rich.table.Table` with columns `field`, `value`, `source`. Include manifest paths, resume roots, webhook payload IDs, warning counts, helper names, and elapsed milliseconds.
- Log helper/function boundaries explicitly (`_resume_capture`, `agents.shared._submit_job`, `_stream_job`) inside a `Panel` or `rich.text.Text` styled with `bold magenta` so ops can map logs to code quickly.
- Close each scenario with a summary panel plus a `rich.progress.Progress` snapshot that shows per-step durations and cumulative runtime. Include exit codes and artifact directories in this footer.

**Scenario coverage (live in `tests/test_e2e_cli.py` unless noted)**
1. `mdwb fetch --resume --webhook-url …`: stub the HTTP client + webhook sender, log every request/response pair, and assert that the summary panel enumerates the job UUID, manifest path, warning tally, and webhook retry decisions.
2. Agent starter script loop (`scripts/agents/summarize_article.py` + `scripts/agents/shared.py`): run via Typer’s `CliRunner`, log the URL, profile_id reuse, section extraction stats, and Markdown excerpt (use `rich.syntax.Syntax` with language=`markdown`). Capture both successful reuse and forced recapture paths.
3. Warning + diag combo: chain `mdwb warnings tail --json` with `mdwb diag manifest`. Log warning codes, thresholds, SSIM overlap metrics, and diag verdicts in the shared table so ops can tie anomalies to manifest IDs.
4. Stretch goal: add a capture pipeline dry-run that exercises `mdwb fetch --dry-run` followed by `scripts/olmocr_cli.py run --dry-run`, ensuring the logs highlight synthetic manifest roots and tile counts.

**Automation + artifacts**
- Gate execution behind `MDWB_RUN_E2E_RICH=1` (default off) in `scripts/run_checks.sh`. When enabled, run the suite immediately after the CLI pytest matrix but before Prometheus/exporter or Playwright smoke steps.
- Emit both text and HTML transcripts at `tmp/rich_e2e_cli.log` / `tmp/rich_e2e_cli.html` so Agent Mail beads and dashboards can deep-link to a stable artifact.
- Record the current logging template hash (`RICH_E2E_TEMPLATE=v1`) inside the summary panel and propagate it into `manifest.environment.rich_logging_hash` so capture manifests + test runs can be correlated.
- Document the suite in README §9 + docs/ops §9, including the env toggle, artifact paths, and usage instructions for ops/qa.

Success criteria: tests must assert on both functional outcomes (CLI behavior, stub invocations) and the presence/ordering of `Panel/Table/Syntax/Progress` blocks. Missing rich elements should fail fast to keep the logging contract enforceable.

_2025-11-09 — PurpleBear (bd-rle) implemented FlowLogger v2 + the `mdwb fetch --resume --webhook` scenario with transcript exports (`tmp/rich_e2e_cli.(log|html)`) and Progress/Timing panels; next beads (bd-rlc/bd-rlp) will extend coverage to agent scripts + warning/diag combos and wire the run_checks toggle/docs._
_2025-11-09 — PurpleBear (bd-rlc) extended the suite with the agent summarize flow + the warnings tail + diag combo, both emitting the new transcript artifacts and asserting on FlowLogger progress/timing blocks so §14.2 scenarios 2-3 are covered._
_2025-11-09 — PurpleBear (bd-rlp) added the `MDWB_RUN_E2E_RICH` + `RICH_E2E_ARTIFACT_DIR` wiring in `scripts/run_checks.sh`/docs so FlowLogger runs stay opt-in and copy their transcripts into `tmp/rich_e2e_cli/` for CI artifacts._
_2025-11-09 — PurpleBear (bd-hki) upgraded `tests/test_e2e_generated.py` with FlowLogger logging, diff snippets, and README/docs guidance (`MDWB_RUN_E2E_GENERATED`, `MDWB_GENERATED_E2E_CASES`) so the generative guardrail suite is actionable when toggled on._

## 15. Roadmap Enhancements

- Layout hints: inject invisible DOM watermarks to help tiling seam detection.
- Semantic post-processing: optional LLM pass to fix broken lists/tables.
- Citations/back-links: embed `<!-- source:tile_i offset_y -->` comments for provenance (strengthened via Section 19.4.3).
- Crawl mode: depth-1 link expansion with domain allowlist and concurrency caps.
- PDF capture improvements deferred (Section 19.12).

_2025-11-08 — BlueMountain (bd-692, bd-we4, bd-n5c) opened beads for the seam watermarks, semantic post-processing toggle, and depth-1 crawl mode so these §15 bullets move beyond wishlist status._
_2025-11-09 — RedDog (bd-692) implemented viewport seam watermarks (hashed CSS overlays + seam hash metadata) so tiles/manifest/CLI surface deterministic seam markers for debugging._

---

## 16. Rationale: Why Screenshot-First Wins

- **Fidelity:** exact pixels as seen by users; print CSS often hides nav/asides or reflows content.
- **Dynamic content:** canvas charts, lazy-loaded images, client-rendered components are captured accurately.
- **Predictable OCR scale:** we control resolution/tiling; no multi-page print pagination artifacts.
- **Simplicity:** one representation (PNG tiles) across all sites; fewer one-off workarounds.
- **Agent context:** DOM-derived Links Appendix + sqlite-vec search compensates for OCR’s lack of clickable anchors.

---

## 17. Open Questions (MVP validation)

- Optimal overlap/window for seam dedup across diverse typography when SSIM heuristics are in play.
- Whether hyphenation fixes harm code blocks/inline math; need guardrails/tests.
- Best concurrency vs rate-limit curve for remote FP8 endpoint vs local toolkit.
- How much DOM text patching (Section 19.5) we can do before hallucinating mismatches.

_2025-11-08 — BlueMountain (bd-0jc) opened to run the overlap/SSIM + hyphenation guard experiments and feed the findings back into defaults/tests._

---

## 18. Quickstart (Developer)

1. `uv venv --python 3.13 && uv sync`
2. `playwright install chromium`
3. `cp .env.example .env` and fill in API keys
4. `uv run python -m app.main` → open `http://localhost:8000`

## 19. Incremental Upgrade Plan (2025 Q4)

Below is a focused, pragmatic list of near-term upgrades. They map to the sections above so you can implement them without re-architecting.

### 19.1 OCR & Inference Upgrades (hosted olmOCR focus)
> _Status 2025-11-08 — OrangeDog (bd: markdown_web_browser-716) shipped OCR batching (<25 MB payload guard), request-level telemetry (latency/status/request IDs), quota warnings at 70 % usage, FP8-aware retries (3s/9s), manifest fields `ocr_batches` + `ocr_quota`, and the `mdwb jobs ocr-metrics` CLI helper so ops can correlate throttling with DOM complexity without opening manifest files._
- **Single provider clarity.** `olmOCR-2-7B-1025-FP8` via the hosted API is the only supported model for now. Keep the UI dropdown but mark other entries “future” to avoid confusion.
- **Batching & concurrency.** Size OCR batches so each request stays <25 MB and target 6–8 in-flight requests (tunable per latency telemetry). Track per-request latency, HTTP status, and token usage in the manifest so you can correlate spikes with page complexity.
- **Quota & retry budgets.** Implement token-rate alarms: warn when daily usage hits 70 % of quota, and cap retries at 2 with exponential backoff (3s, 9s). Log the remote request ID in the job manifest to speed up vendor support.
- **Fallback playbook.** When the hosted API throttles or errors persist >5 minutes, surface a UI banner (“OCR degraded”) and queue jobs rather than silently failing. Document switch-over steps (pause new jobs, notify vendor, resume once healthy) in the ops runbook.

### 19.2 Browser Capture Reliability & Determinism
> _Status 2025-11-08 — FuchsiaPond (bd: markdown_web_browser-t82) wired CfT pinning + viewport sweep instrumentation, including SPA shrink detection with configurable retry limits recorded in manifests._
- **Chrome for Testing binaries.** Switch Playwright to CfT channel, log `cft_version` in `manifest.json`, and expose a health check/test that ensures the pinned version is installed.
- **CfT label + build.** When Google publishes label tracks (e.g., `Stable`, `Stable-1`, `Stable-2`), record both the label and exact build number for every run. Use labels for day-to-day pinning (easy rollbacks) and fall back to explicit builds when diagnosing regressions; keep both in the manifest and ops dashboards.
- **Viewport sweep instead of `full_page=True`.** Implement deterministic viewport-sized tiling with overlap stitching to avoid missing elements based on scroll position.
- **CDP vs BiDi fallback.** Default to CDP for CfT Chromium but support WebDriver BiDi when CDP features lag or when cross-browser capture is required. Surface the chosen transport in manifests/tests so issues can be bisected quickly.
- **Playwright ≥1.50 + normalized rendering.** Require Playwright 1.50 or newer for built-in animation freezes (`animations:"disabled"`), `expect(page).toHaveScreenshot()` assertions, and locator `hasNot*` filters. Always set reduced motion, disable animations, fix `deviceScaleFactor=2`, enforce `colorScheme="light"`, and inject blocklist CSS via screenshot `style`. Record `playwright_version` and `screenshot_style_hash` in manifests.
- **Scroll policy revamp.** Use scrollHeight + network-idle stabilization with IntersectionObserver sentinels; retry if SPA shrinks height mid-run.

### 19.3 Tiling, Image IO, and Compression
> _Status 2025-11-08 — FuchsiaPond (bd: markdown_web_browser-t82) implemented pyvips-based tiler enforcing 1288 px longest side + 120 px overlap, plus top/bottom overlap hashes for future SSIM seam trimming._
- Enforce 1288 px longest side (downscale if necessary) and track original DPI/scale.
- Migrate heavy operations to pyvips, retaining Pillow only for niche formats.
- Tune PNG encode (Q=9, palette off) and optionally run background `oxipng` to trim caches.
- Compute SSIM in overlap strips (≈120 px) to auto-trim duplicate lines.

### 19.4 Stitching: Safer Merges & Provenance
_2025-11-08 — BlueMountain (bd-b9e) opened to land DOM-guided heading leveling, SSIM-gated table merges, richer provenance comments, and the artifact highlight helper promised in this section._
_2025-11-09 — RedDog (bd-b9e) delivered the seam markers + enriched provenance comments and overlap-aware table header trimming so reviewers can see exactly where tiles merged and why headers were dropped._
_2025-11-09 — PinkCastle (bd-b9e follow-up) hardened the stitcher: table header trimming now ignores blank/comment prologues, DOM assists merge multi-line hyphen splits while preserving list/blockquote prefixes, overlay candidates are consumed FIFO to keep duplicates aligned, and the warnings CLI table now folds seam/sweep cells so ratios stay readable in Rich output._
_2025-11-09 — BrownHill (bd-692/bd-md3) threaded seam marker/hash counts through RunRecord, `/jobs/{id}` snapshots, and the `mdwb diag/show` commands so seam telemetry stays available even when the manifest is missing or cached._
- DOM-guided heading leveling that stores the original line in an HTML comment right above normalized content.
- Table merge heuristics keyed on repeated header rows + high SSIM; otherwise keep blocks separate.
- Upgrade provenance comments to `<!-- source: tile_i, y=1234, sha256=..., scale=2.0 -->` and add `/jobs/{id}/artifact/... ?highlight=tile_i,y0,y1` viewer helpers.

### 19.5 Hybrid Text Recovery (opt-in)
> _Status 2025-11-08 — OrangeDog (bd: markdown_web_browser-ogf) wired DOM+OCR link blending so `links.json` and the Links tab highlight OCR-only/DOM-only deltas; OCR-derived links now come from the Markdown output once stitching completes._
- _2025-11-08 — BlueMountain (bd-805) opened to implement the low-confidence OCR detectors + DOM text overlays so headings/captions can be patched automatically when OCR struggles._
- _2025-11-09 — BlueMountain (bd-805) delivered the first hybrid recovery pass: low-confidence heuristics now patch Markdown with DOM text (manifest `dom_assists`, event + CLI diag output, and highlight links for quick inspection)._ 
- _2025-11-09 — PinkCastle (bd-805 follow-up) added spaced-letter/code-fence guards plus manifest/SSE summaries so CLI/UI panels show DOM-assist counts, reason buckets, and sample text without cracking manifests._
- _2025-11-09 — PinkCastle (bd-805 follow-up) layered in density/ratio metrics so dom_assist summaries report assists per tile and per reason, keeping manifests/SSE/CLI/warning logs aligned for future dashboards._
- _2025-11-09 — PinkCastle (bd-805 follow-up) exported dom_assist density + per-reason ratios to Prometheus (`mdwb_dom_assist_density`, `mdwb_dom_assist_reason_ratio`) so dashboards can alert when hybrid recovery spikes._
- _2025-11-09 — RedMountain (markdown_web_browser-co1) taught the SSE snapshot builder to fall back to `manifest.dom_assist_summary` (and reuse the shared warning_log helper) so cached/replayed jobs keep emitting DOM-assist events even when the raw `dom_assists` list is absent, and the fallback summarizer now honors `tiles_total` so assist density/ratios stay accurate when we have to recompute._
- _2025-11-09 — RedMountain (markdown_web_browser-co1) taught the SSE snapshot builder to fall back to `manifest.dom_assist_summary` (and reuse the shared warning_log helper) so cached/replayed jobs keep emitting DOM-assist events even when the raw `dom_assists` list is absent, and the fallback summarizer now honors `tiles_total` so assist density/ratios stay accurate when we have to recompute._
- _2025-11-09 — PinkCastle (bd-co1 assist) pairing with RedMountain on the CLI resume/watch audit (ResumeManager stress tests + `_watch_events_with_fallback` reconnect fixes)._ 
- Detect low-confidence OCR regions (symbol rate, low alpha ratio, hyphen density) and patch them with DOM text overlays scoped to the offending block (hero headings, captions, icon fonts).

### 19.6 Caching, Indexing, Retrieval Quality

> **Progress — 2025-11-08 (BlackPond):** Persistence layer + embeddings search endpoints are live. `app/store.py`, `app/embeddings.py`, and `app/main.py` now expose sqlite-vec backed upsert/search helpers plus `/jobs/{id}/embeddings/search`, with docs/config updated to match.
> _Status 2025-11-08 — FuchsiaPond (bd: markdown_web_browser-t82) integrated the capture pipeline with `Store`, so manifests + tiles are written to cache directories and RunRecord metadata updates automatically once captures finish._
- _2025-11-08 — RedBear (bd-x6v) implemented the cache key/index so identical runs reuse artifacts (manifests/CLI now surface `cache_hit`, and `/jobs` accepts `reuse_cache` to override the behavior)._
- Add sqlite-vec section embeddings keyed by `(run_id, section_id, tile_range)` for instant "jump to section" queries.
- Content-address caches by `(normalized_url, cft_version, viewport, deviceScaleFactor, model_name, model_rev)`.
- Offer tar.zst bundle downloads of `artifact/`, `out.md`, `links.json`, `manifest.json` using Zstandard.

### 19.7 API & UI Ergonomics
- Integrate the official HTMX SSE extension so markup stays declarative (`hx-ext="sse" hx-sse="connect:/jobs/{id}/stream swap:progress"`).
- Add `/jobs/{id}/events` JSONLines feed for agents/CLI `--follow` workflows.
- Enhance the Links tab with per-domain grouping, target rel column, and "DOM vs OCR delta" badge.

_2025-11-08 — RedBear (bd-4wx) opened to swap the bespoke EventSource wiring for the HTMX SSE extension so §19.7 becomes reality._
_2025-11-09 — BlueMountain (bd-4wx) landed the HTMX SSE integration: `hx-ext="sse"` drives `/jobs/{id}/stream`, the JS bridge now listens to `htmx:sse*` events (including dom_assist summaries), and the manual EventSource shim is gone._

### 19.8 Performance & Concurrency
- Offer Granian as an alternative ASGI server, document when to use it, and expose toggles in ops docs.
- Implement concurrency autotune: start at `min(8, cpu_count)` OCR in-flight requests, adjust based on p95 + 5xx rate, and emit "throttle to N" events in UI.
- Enable HTTP/2 in httpx, reuse connections, gzip Markdown streams.

_2025-11-08 — RedBear (bd-l9n) is covering the Granian toggle/runbook so §19.8 has a concrete deployment story._
_2025-11-09 — RedDog (bd-l9n) shipped `scripts/run_server.py` + `SERVER_IMPL` toggles, updated `scripts/dev_run.sh`, manifests (`environment.server_runtime`), SQLite columns, and README/docs/ops so ops can choose uvicorn vs Granian with documented flags + tests._
_2025-11-08 — BlueMountain (bd-90m) opened to wire the OCR concurrency autotune + HTTP/2 reuse so the remaining §19.8 bullets have an owner._
_2025-11-09 — RedDog (bd-90m) delivered the adaptive OCR concurrency controller (manifest `ocr_autotune`, SSE/CLI/UI surfacing, regression tests) so the pipeline scales between `OCR_MIN_CONCURRENCY`/`OCR_MAX_CONCURRENCY` automatically._

### 19.9 Robustness & Anti-Flakiness
- Maintain versioned CSS/selector blocklists (JSON) with per-domain overrides; inject via screenshot style or `page.addStyleTag`.
  - Detect canvas/video-heavy tiles and show warnings plus raw tile thumbnails near Markdown blocks.
  - Retry viewport sweeps when shrinkage detected; record both sweeps in manifest.
  _2025-11-08 — BrownStone (bd-dm9) wired `config/blocklist.json` + `app.blocklist` loader into capture. Manifest now records blocklist version, per-selector hit counts, and warning codes (`canvas_heavy`, `video_overlay`, `sticky_chrome`)._

### 19.10 Test Plan Additions

_2025-11-08 — PinkCreek (bd-ug0) threading the new guards into automated runners (ruff/ty, viewport sweep regression, smoke capture) plus nightly/weekly job wiring._
- CfT pinning test (manifest vs installed binary).
- Full-page omission regression test using known repro page from Playwright issue tracker.
- Table split fuzzer for SSIM + header repetition logic.
- Scroll stabilization harness that mocks pages with height bursts.

### 19.11 Doc & Config Tweaks
- `pyproject.toml`: add `[project.optional-dependencies.local-ocr]`, ensure `granian` present.
- `manifest.json`: include CfT version, Playwright version, screenshot style hash, model revision, long-side px.
- `.env.example`: add `OCR_LOCAL_URL` and `OCR_USE_FP8`.

### 19.12 Deferrals (Nice-to-have)
- PDF capture improvements remain optional (use `Page.printToPDF` only when explicitly requested).
- Semantic post-edit stays behind a flag; olmOCR-2 already improves math/tables—avoid over-editing by default.

### 19.13 Why These Upgrades Matter
- Strict alignment with olmOCR-2 guidance (1288 px, FP8) yields instant quality/perf boosts.
- CfT pinning + viewport sweeps remove flaky captures and make runs reproducible.
- pyvips and sqlite-vec drive measurable throughput and retrieval wins without new infra.
- HTMX SSE + `/events` keep the frontend tiny and agents happy.

### 19.14 Hosted olmOCR CLI integration

_2025-11-08 — PinkCreek (bd-ug0) replaced the placeholder with the Typer/Rich CLI plus API_BASE_URL/MDWB_API_KEY plumbing; next up is wiring nightly smoke + weekly latency harnesses. FuchsiaMountain (bd-rn4/4dq) subsequently imported the upstream GPU/vLLM docs (`docs/olmocr_cli_tool_documentation.md`, `docs/olmocr_cli_integration.md`) and staged `scripts/setup_olmocr_cuda12.sh` so the CUDA flow stays in lockstep with the CLI._
- **Scripts + docs.** Copy `scripts/olmocr_cli.py` and `docs/olmocr_cli.md` from `/data/projects/olmocr/` (the Typer CLI + documentation) into this repo. Treat them as the blessed way to run batch jobs or debug hosted OCR latency outside the web UI.
- **Config surface.** Keep the CLI defaulting to the hosted API URL; expose knobs for `--server-url`, `--workers`, and `--tensor-parallel-size` but document that TP>1 is only relevant if we later reintroduce local inference.
- **Ops usage.** Point on-call guides to `olmocr_cli.py run --workspace …` for reproducing customer issues quickly, since it already filters noisy logs and streams ETA.
- **Maintenance.** When we upgrade dependency pins (PyTorch, FlashInfer, etc.) in the CLI’s source repo, mirror the updates here so the instructions never drift. The integration doc (`docs/olmocr_cli_integration.md`) tracks the merge plan for the richer GPU CLI with our existing API helpers.

## 20. Operational Playbooks & Metrics

_2025-11-08 — PinkCreek (bd-ug0) designing ops automation: smoke/latency job runners, Prometheus/Grafana updates, and release checklists for Sections 20.1-20.4._

### 20.1 Capture & OCR SLOs
- **SLO definition:** 99% of jobs finish within 2× the rolling 7-day p95 for that URL category (news, docs, app). Track both capture latency and OCR latency separately.
- **Error budgets:** Dedicate 25% of weekly engineering time to burn-down whenever error budget drops below 90%; prioritize CfT drift, overlay blocklists, or OCR timeout spikes.
- **Budget attribution:** Manifest fields (`capture_ms`, `tiling_ms`, `ocr_ms`, `stitch_ms`) roll up into BigQuery/duckdb so you can attribute regressions to either Playwright upgrades or model changes.
_2025-11-08 — BlueMountain (bd-md3) opened to automate these SLO rollups + dashboards so error-budget tracking isn’t manual._
_2025-11-09 — BrownHill (bd-md3) extended `scripts/run_smoke.py` + `scripts/show_latest_smoke.py` to record capture/total/OCR p95/p99 values, flag SLO breaches per category, and added `scripts/check_metrics.py --check-weekly` so CI/on-call can fail fast when the weekly summary exceeds its 2×p95 budgets._
_2025-11-09 — PinkHill (bd-md3) documented the seam marker telemetry workflow so ops can plug the `weekly_summary.json` seam count/hash percentiles into Grafana/Prometheus alongside the capture/OCR SLO panels (README/docs/ops updated)._

### 20.2 Monitoring & Alerting
- **Metrics:** expose `/metrics` with Prometheus counters and histograms (tiles_processed_total, ocr_retry_total, capture_duration_seconds_bucket). Include labels for model, CfT version, and concurrency tier.
- **Dashboards:** `ops/dashboards.json` ships Grafana panels for scroll stabilization success rate, overlay blocklist hits, SSE heartbeat latency, and DOM vs OCR link delta distributions.
- **Alert rules:**
  - `HighCaptureLatency`: p95 capture_duration > 120s for 15 minutes.
  - `OCRThrottleSpike`: `ocr_retry_total{reason="throttle"}` rate > 5/min.
  - `SSEDrop`: SSE heartbeat gap > 12s (monitor via HTMX ping endpoint).
- Health check CLI: `uv run python scripts/check_metrics.py` hits the API `/metrics` endpoint plus the standalone exporter on `PROMETHEUS_PORT`. Use `--include-exporter/--no-include-exporter`, `--exporter-host/--exporter-port/--exporter-url`, and `--json` when automation needs structured results. `scripts/run_checks.sh` exposes the same check behind `MDWB_CHECK_METRICS=1` (respect `CHECK_METRICS_TIMEOUT` to tweak the probe window).
_2025-11-08 — WhiteCastle (bd-7sx) wired Prometheus instrumentation (`prometheus-fastapi-instrumentator` + background exporter on `PROMETHEUS_PORT`) and custom metrics covering capture/OCR/stitch histograms, warning/blocklist counters, SSE/NDJSON heartbeats, and job completion totals. `/metrics` now exposes the same registry for local smoke checks and CI._
_2025-11-08 — WhiteCastle (bd-bb4) added `scripts/check_metrics.py` so CI/ops can ping `/metrics` + the standalone exporter with one command; docs/ops now reference the helper alongside the manual curl examples (and the CLI emits JSON for dashboards)._
_2025-11-08 — WhiteCastle (bd-2n8) added an opt-in Prometheus smoke step to `scripts/run_checks.sh` (enable via `MDWB_CHECK_METRICS=1`, override timeout with `CHECK_METRICS_TIMEOUT`) so CI/deploy scripts can ping `/metrics` whenever the API is reachable._
_2025-11-08 — WhiteCastle (bd-ljl/rqn) extended `scripts/check_metrics.py` with `--exporter-url` + `--json` flags, documented the legacy `scripts/prom_scrape_check.py` wrapper, and updated README/docs/ops to call out the optional run_checks toggle for telemetry smoke._
_2025-11-08 — PurpleHill (bd-ljl/rqn) enriched the `--json` output from `scripts/check_metrics.py` with `generated_at`, `ok_count`, `failed_count`, and per-target entries so CI dashboards can consume a structured summary directly, and refreshed README/docs/ops to highlight `MDWB_CHECK_METRICS`/`CHECK_METRICS_TIMEOUT` and the legacy `scripts/prom_scrape_check.py` wrapper._
_2025-11-08 — RedSnow (bd-ljl/rqn follow-up) added per-target `duration_ms` plus `total_duration_ms` to the JSON summary and documented the probe timing fields in README/docs/ops so telemetry dashboards can reason about scrape latency._
_2025-11-08 — PurpleHill (bd-3aa) added the `MDWB_RUN_E2E=1` toggle to `scripts/run_checks.sh` for on-demand FlowLogger runs (now superseded by `MDWB_RUN_E2E_RICH=1` after bd-rlp so the original flag can stay lightweight)._
_2025-11-08 — PinkDog (bd-oqr) added the `mdwb diag <job_id>` CLI command so on-call engineers can pull CfT/Playwright metadata, capture/OCR/stitch timings, warnings, and blocklist hits (with `--json` output) straight from the CLI per the Section 20 playbook._

### 20.3 Release & Regression Process
- **Chrome for Testing pinning:** upgrade CfT monthly; run the viewport sweep regression test plus the full-page omission golden test before merging. Record the CfT tag in `manifest.json` and release notes.
- **Playwright upgrades:** follow the release notes (Section 19 references) and rerun scroll stabilization harness + blocklist snapshots.
- **CfT labels vs builds:** document when labels shift (e.g., Stable → Stable-1) and ensure manifests + dashboards carry both label and build. Roll forward/backward by adjusting labels first; only pin explicit builds when debugging.
- **Model updates:** when bumping olmOCR or policy YAML, regenerate `models.yaml` docs, rerun table split fuzzers, and stage a baseline job set (top 20 URLs) to compare DOM vs OCR link deltas.
- **Canary:** run nightly canaries against 5 representative URLs with both remote FP8 and local toolkit to ensure parity; fail the canary job if Markdown diff > 2% or embeddings drift > 0.1 cosine.
- **Screenshot stabilization checklist:** before tagging a release, verify (a) `[aria-busy=true]` nodes clear, (b) volatile widgets (clocks, tickers, ads) are masked via Playwright config, (c) animation disabling + caret hiding is enabled, and (d) CSS blocklist entries were reviewed/updated (`docs/blocklist.md`). Document completion in release notes.
- **CLI verification:** For capture/OCR fixes, run `scripts/olmocr_cli.py run` against at least two URLs in the production smoke set to ensure the hosted API + CLI workflow stay healthy. Log request IDs in the release notes for traceability.

_2025-11-09 — RedDog (bd-e0q) added `docs/release_checklist.md` capturing the full CfT/Playwright/model release workflow (config capture, test matrix, artifact list, sign-off steps) and linked it from README/docs so §20.3 now points at a concrete runbook._

### 20.4 Incident Response Ladder
1. **Acknowledge:** SSE/UI banner plus PagerDuty page when capture or OCR SLO alert fires.
2. **Triage:** check ops dashboard to identify CfT, blocklist, or OCR backend as culprit; reference manifest samples via `mdwb diag <job id>`.
3. **Mitigate:** toggle concurrency autopilot limits (`OCR_MAX_CONCURRENCY`) or flip to local toolkit if remote is degraded; patch blocklist JSON via admin UI if overlays broke capture.
4. **Postmortem:** write a lightweight retro (Google Doc or `docs/incidents/INC-yyyymmdd.md`) capturing root cause, timelines, manifest snippets, and follow-up tasks (tests, blocklist entries, doc updates).

## 21. Appendix: Reference Configs & Snippets

_2025-11-08 — PinkCreek (bd-ug0) will refresh Sections 21.4-21.5 once the ops pipelines + CLI sync land so manifests/CLI examples stay in lockstep._

mdwb jobs replay manifest cache/example.com/run-2025-11-08/manifest.json --json
```

_2025-11-08 — PinkCreek wired `scripts/mdwb_cli.py` into the shared `.env` config so demo commands (snapshot/links/stream) automatically use `API_BASE_URL` + `MDWB_API_KEY`; override with `--api-base` when pointing at staging._

Use these snippets as scaffolding for docs, onboarding, and regression verification—keep them in sync with real code as part of the release checklist (Section 20.3).

---

## 22. Production Smoke Set & Latency Tracking

_2025-11-08 — PinkCreek (bd-ug0) spinning up nightly smoke + weekly latency automation and wiring manifests/log storage per this section._
- `scripts/run_smoke.py` orchestrates nightly captures per `benchmarks/production_set.json` (writing `manifest_index.json` under `benchmarks/production/<date>/` and refreshing `weekly_summary.json`). See `docs/ops.md` for the runbook + verification checklist.
- Use `--dry-run` to exercise the smoke pipeline without hitting `/jobs`; pair with `--seed` (defaults to `0`) to keep synthetic manifests deterministic so dashboard diffs stay stable. Scope to targeted slices with `--category <name>` (repeatable) when only certain sets need reruns. The script also mirrors the latest run into `benchmarks/production/latest_{manifest_index,summary}.json|md`, and `scripts/show_latest_smoke.py` now prints the summary, manifest index, aggregated metrics, and rolling weekly budget table via `uv run python scripts/show_latest_smoke.py --manifest --metrics --weekly --limit 5`. Set `MDWB_SMOKE_ROOT=/path/to/runs` (or pass `--root`) when the pointer files live outside `benchmarks/production/` so ops can target CI artifacts without reshuffling files, and pass `--json` whenever automation/dashboards need the data in machine-readable form. `scripts/show_latest_smoke.py check --root benchmarks/production --json` exits non-zero if any pointer is missing (and returns a structured payload), making it easy to gate CI/dashboards. _2025-11-08 — BlueHill (bd-h2m/3pr/a2e/2xq) added the weekly view + MDWB_SMOKE_ROOT/`--root` override, JSON output, and the text/JSON check command so ops can inspect or validate summary/manifest/weekly data from one CLI invocation._
- Use `--dry-run` to exercise the smoke pipeline without hitting `/jobs`; pair with `--seed` (defaults to `0`) to keep synthetic manifests deterministic so dashboard diffs stay stable. Scope to targeted slices with `--category <name>` (repeatable) when only certain sets need reruns. The script also mirrors the latest run into `benchmarks/production/latest_{manifest_index,summary}.json|md`, and `scripts/show_latest_smoke.py --root /path/to/run --manifest --metrics --weekly` prints those pointer files on demand so dashboards and humans can grab the freshest run without hunting for dates.
  When a rerun happens outside the standard pipeline, call `scripts/update_smoke_pointers.py <run-dir>` (with `--root`/`--weekly-source` as needed) to refresh the `latest_*` pointers.
- _2025-11-08 — BlueCreek (bd-0rn) added `tests/test_show_latest_smoke.py` so the CLI pointer/manifest/weekly output is covered whenever PLAN §22 evolves._

Focus on a curated set of real customer-style URLs instead of synthetic benchmarks. Maintain `benchmarks/production_set.json` listing each URL, category, and target latency.

| Category | Example URLs | p95 budget |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Docs/articles | 5 long-form articles/docs | ≤25 s |
| Dashboards/apps | 5 authenticated-style dashboards (consent overlays, tables) | ≤45 s |
| Lightweight pages | 3 short marketing/help pages | ≤8 s |

### Nightly smoke run
- Capture each URL once per night using the standard pipeline.
- Record `capture_ms`, `ocr_ms`, `stitch_ms`, tile count, CfT label + build, browser transport, OCR request IDs, and diff stats in `benchmarks/production/<date>/<slug>/manifest.json`.
- Compare Markdown vs. last successful run; flag diffs >2 % or link deltas >10 % for review. Store tiles/DOM snapshots alongside manifests for debugging.

### Weekly latency report
- Aggregate nightly data into `benchmarks/production/weekly_summary.json` with p50/p95 per category and list any runs exceeding budgets.
- Use the summary to decide if a release is safe; if all categories meet budgets, ship. If any URL exceeds budget twice in a week, fix before release.

### Agent readiness checklist
1. Nightly production smoke green for 48 hours (no SLA breaches).
2. Weekly summary shows all categories within latency budgets.
3. Generative E2E guardrail tests (Section 14) green.
4. Hosted OCR quota usage <80 % (Section 19.1 telemetry).

Only when all four items are true should you deploy capture/OCR changes.

## 23. Launch & Demo Strategy

- **Example gallery:** Maintain `docs/gallery/` with side-by-side “screenshot vs Markdown” for 6–8 representative sites (article, dashboard, consent-heavy flow). Update it whenever you tweak capture/stitching so newcomers instantly see the output quality.
- **Hosted sandbox:** Stand up a rate-limited demo (could be the existing FastAPI UI with auth/rate limits) where users can submit a URL and receive Markdown + artifacts. Even if it queues requests, the hands-on experience drives adoption and social sharing.
- **Agent starter scripts:** Include a `scripts/agents/` folder (or docs section) with ready-to-run examples—e.g., “Summarize a news article via CLI + hosted LLM,” “Generate TODOs from a dashboard”—so agent builders can integrate quickly.
_2025-11-08 — RedSnow (bd-oez) added `scripts/agents/` with `summarize_article` + `generate_todos` Typer helpers (plus shared polling utilities), lightweight tests, README/docs sections, and wired the new test into `scripts/run_checks.sh` so PLAN §23 is unblocked._
_2025-11-08 — WhiteDog (bd-dex) extended the agent starter docs/tests so both scripts honor `--out` (text vs JSON via `shared.save_text/save_json`) and added regression coverage for env-root pointer checks in `scripts/show_latest_smoke.py`._
- **Markdown dataset drop:** Periodically publish a small “Markdown Web Browser Corpus” (e.g., 25 popular sites converted) with manifests and links JSON under a permissive license. This gives researchers and agent hackers immediate fodder and shows confidence in the pipeline.
- **Messaging checklist:** When announcing releases, lead with simple proof points (“Any webpage → auditable Markdown with tiling + provenance in <30 s”). Link to the gallery/demo/dataset so people can try it without cloning.
