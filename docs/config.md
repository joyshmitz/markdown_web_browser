# Configuration Reference

_Last updated: 2025-11-07 (UTC)_

All runtime configuration flows through `python-decouple`. Import
`app.settings.settings` instead of reading environment variables directly so the
browser/OCR defaults stay consistent across services and manifests.

```python
from app.settings import settings

print(settings.browser.cft_version)
print(settings.ocr.server_url)
```

## Environment Variables

| Name | Default | Purpose / Manifest Echo |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `OLMOCR_SERVER` | `https://ai2endpoints.cirrascale.ai/api` | Remote olmOCR endpoint recorded as `ocr.server_url`. Required for `scripts/olmocr_cli.py`. |
| `OLMOCR_API_KEY` | *(unset)* | API key for hosted olmOCR. Required outside local dev (CLI now enforces this). |
| `OLMOCR_MODEL` | `olmOCR-2-7B-1025-FP8` | Default OCR policy identifier included in manifests + provenance comments (required by CLI). |
| `API_BASE_URL` | `http://localhost:8000` | FastAPI base URL consumed by the CLI + automation; the CLI now fails fast if unset. |
| `MDWB_API_KEY` | *(unset)* | Optional bearer token for `/jobs` HTTP calls (CLI + automation). |
| `OCR_LOCAL_URL` | *(unset)* | Optional self-hosted olmOCR endpoint; overrides `OLMOCR_SERVER` when set. |
| `OCR_USE_FP8` | `true` | Whether FP8 inference is enabled; surfaced via `environment.ocr_use_fp8`. |
| `OCR_MAX_BATCH_TILES` | `3` | Maximum number of tiles bundled into each OCR HTTP request (helps keep payloads deterministic). |
| `OCR_MAX_BATCH_BYTES` | `25000000` | Byte ceiling for a single OCR request; batches exceeding this size are split automatically. |
| `OCR_DAILY_QUOTA_TILES` | *(unset)* | Optional hosted OCR quota (in tiles). When set, manifests emit warnings at 70 % usage. |
| `OCR_MIN_CONCURRENCY` | `2` | Minimum OCR concurrency window (`environment.ocr_concurrency.min`). |
| `OCR_MAX_CONCURRENCY` | `8` | Maximum OCR concurrency window (`environment.ocr_concurrency.max`). Must be ≥ min. |
| `CACHE_ROOT` | `.cache` | Root directory for content-addressed artifacts (tiles, manifests, tar bundles) and persistent Chromium profiles (`CACHE_ROOT/profiles/<id>/storage_state.json`). |
| `RUNS_DB_PATH` | `runs.db` | SQLite file storing `runs`, `links`, and sqlite-vec embeddings. |
| `CFT_VERSION` | `chrome-130.0.6723.69` | Chrome for Testing label/build pinned for Playwright; log in every manifest. |
| `CFT_LABEL` | `Stable-1` | CfT channel label surfaced in `environment.cft_label`. |
| `PLAYWRIGHT_CHANNEL` | `cft` | Browser channel launched by Playwright. Accepts a comma-separated preference list (e.g., `cft,chromium`) so operators can note the fallback order when CfT isn’t available locally. |
| `PLAYWRIGHT_TRANSPORT` | `cdp` | Transport used to drive Chromium (`cdp` or `bidi`). Also accepts comma-separated preferences (e.g., `bidi,cdp`) so CI metadata clarifies the intended fallback. |
| `CAPTURE_VIEWPORT_WIDTH` | `1280` | Pixel width for captures + manifest `viewport.width`. |
| `CAPTURE_VIEWPORT_HEIGHT` | `2000` | Pixel height for captures + manifest `viewport.height`. |
| `CAPTURE_DEVICE_SCALE_FACTOR` | `2` | DSF used for capture; feeds screenshot style hash + manifest viewport block. |
| `CAPTURE_COLOR_SCHEME` | `light` | Color scheme forced during capture (manifest `viewport.color_scheme`). |
| `CANVAS_WARNING_THRESHOLD` | `3` | Canvas element count that emits a `canvas-heavy` capture warning. |
| `VIDEO_WARNING_THRESHOLD` | `2` | Video element count that emits a `video-heavy` capture warning. |
| `SEAM_WARNING_RATIO` | `0.9` | Overlap match ratio that triggers a duplicate-seam warning. |
| `SEAM_WARNING_MIN_PAIRS` | `5` | Minimum overlap pair count before seam warnings fire. |
| `SCROLL_SHRINK_WARNING_THRESHOLD` | `1` | Number of scroll-height shrink events before emitting a `scroll-shrink` warning. |
| `OVERLAP_WARNING_RATIO` | `0.65` | Minimum acceptable overlap match ratio (0–1); lower ratios trigger `overlap-low`. |
| `BLOCKLIST_PATH` | `config/blocklist.json` | JSON selectors injected during capture; recorded via `manifest.blocklist_version`. |
| `WARNING_LOG_PATH` | `ops/warnings.jsonl` | JSONL file that stores capture warning/blocklist incidents. |
| `MDWB_SMOKE_ROOT` | `benchmarks/production` | Optional override for the smoke pointer directory consumed by `scripts/show_latest_smoke.py`; set when the latest summary/manifest/weekly files live elsewhere (e.g., CI artifacts). |
| `VIEWPORT_OVERLAP_PX` | `120` | Pixels of overlap between viewport sweeps (Plan §19.2). |
| `CAPTURE_LONG_SIDE_PX` | `1288` | Tile longest side enforced by pyvips tiler + CLI defaults. |
| `TILE_OVERLAP_PX` | `120` | Overlap inside the pyvips tiler; must match SSIM stitching heuristics. |
| `SCROLL_SETTLE_MS` | `350` | Wait time between scrolls so lazy-loaded content settles. |
| `MAX_VIEWPORT_SWEEPS` | `200` | Guardrail to prevent infinite scroll loops. |
| `SCROLL_SHRINK_RETRIES` | `2` | Number of times to re-sweep when SPA height shrinks mid-run. Logged in manifest stats. |
| `SCREENSHOT_MASK_SELECTORS` | *(empty)* | Comma-separated selectors masked during screenshots (cookie banners, tickers). |
| `SCREENSHOT_STYLE_HASH` | auto-derived if blank | Hash of viewport/mask settings included in manifests & bug reports. |
| `PROMETHEUS_PORT` | `9000` | Port for the standalone Prometheus exporter (the API also exposes `/metrics`). |
| `HTMX_SSE_HEARTBEAT_MS` | `4000` | Interval (ms) for SSE heartbeat events streamed to the UI. |
| `WEBHOOK_SECRET` | `mdwb-dev-webhook` | Shared secret used to sign `/jobs/{id}/webhooks` callbacks. |
| `MDWB_SERVER_IMPL` | `uvicorn` | API server runtime used by `scripts/run_server.py` (`uvicorn` for dev, `granian` for higher throughput). |
| `MDWB_SERVER_WORKERS` | `1` | Worker processes for the launcher (set higher in production or when using Granian). |
| `MDWB_GRANIAN_RUNTIME_THREADS` | `1` | Runtime threads per worker when running under Granian. |
| `MDWB_SERVER_LOG_LEVEL` | `info` | Verbosity for both runtimes; mirrors `--log-level`. |

Add any new variables to `.env.example`, document them here, and update the
manifest schema if they need to be echoed downstream.

### GLM-OCR Contract Notes (bd-361.1.2)
- No new environment keys are required for contract validation work.
- For **local OpenAI-compatible GLM-OCR** serving, existing `OCR_LOCAL_URL` can point at
  a `/v1` endpoint (for example vLLM/SGLang with `glm-ocr` served model name).
- For **GLM MaaS** contract validation, treat the request as a separate provider contract:
  `{"model":"glm-ocr","file":"<url-or-data-uri>"}` where `file` is URL or data URI.
- During adapter rollout beads, manifest metadata must explicitly capture
  backend mode (`maas` vs `openai-compatible`) and normalized reason codes.

### Validating configuration
- Run `uv run python scripts/check_env.py` to verify all required variables are present.
  Use `--json` for machine-readable output in CI.
- The script fails (exit code 1) when a required setting is missing, helping catch
  misconfigured environments before capture jobs run.

## Manifest Metadata

`app.settings.Settings.manifest_environment()` returns the canonical dictionary
used by the capture pipeline when building `manifest.json`. The Pydantic models
in `app/schemas.py` (see `ManifestEnvironment`, `ManifestTimings`, and
`ManifestMetadata`) ensure each manifest records:

* CfT version + Playwright channel/version
* Browser transport (CDP vs BiDi)
* Viewport + overlap metadata (width/height/DSF, long-side policy, settle timers, mask selectors)
* Screenshot style hash for the masked/blocked CSS bundle
* Warning entries (canvas/video-heavy) with counts + thresholds so Ops can escalate overlays
* Sweep stats (`sweep_stats`) that show shrink events, retry attempts, and overlap match ratios to explain seam trims or viewport restarts
* `overlap_match_ratio` shortcut so dashboards/CLIs can summarize seam health without unpacking the stats block
* `validation_failures` array that records any tile integrity errors caught by `validate_tiles()` and feeds the warning log even when no other warnings fired
* OCR model + FP8 status + concurrency window
* OCR backend provenance (`backend_id`, `backend_mode`, `hardware_path`, `fallback_chain`) so adapters/policy decisions are auditable per run
* Policy trace metadata (`backend_reason_codes`, `backend_reevaluate_after_s`) so failover behavior is explainable and replayable
* Host hardware capability snapshot (`hardware_capabilities`) so policy decisions can be replayed against the detected CPU/GPU inventory
* OCR request telemetry (`ocr_batches`) including latency, HTTP status, request IDs, and payload sizes, plus hosted quota status (`ocr_quota`) so ops can correlate throttling with DOM complexity
* Timing metrics (`capture_ms`, `ocr_ms`, `stitch_ms`, `total_ms`) once stages
  execute
* Cache metadata (`cache_hit`, `cache_key`) so dashboards/CLI output can distinguish fresh captures from cache replays
* DOM assist overlays (`dom_assists`) plus the summary fields (`dom_assist_summary`) that report counts, assist density (assists ÷ tiles_total), and per-reason ratios so ops/debuggers can monitor hybrid recovery health

## Operational Defaults & Notes

* Always run Playwright with `viewport=1280×2000`, `deviceScaleFactor=2`,
  `colorScheme="light"`, reduced motion, and animation disabling so CfT output
  is deterministic. The shared `playwright.config.mjs` (used by `scripts/run_checks.sh`
  and `npx playwright test`) encodes these defaults and respects
  `PLAYWRIGHT_TRANSPORT` (cdp/bidi) plus mask selectors from env.
* Tiling policy: longest side ≤1288 px with ≈120 px overlap (Plan §§3, 19.3).
* Use HTTP/2 (`httpx.AsyncClient(http2=True)`) when sending many OCR tiles to
  the same host; document rate limits + concurrency in manifests so Ops can
  correlate spikes.
* Prometheus + HTMX SSE heartbeat intervals come directly from this config—keep
  dashboards/tests in sync with any changes.
* `MDWB_SERVER_IMPL` controls whether `scripts/run_server.py` launches uvicorn or Granian. The chosen runtime is echoed into manifests (`environment.server_runtime`) and stored in SQLite so cache hits/logs can be filtered by server type.
* The warning/blocklist JSONL log now includes `sweep_stats`, overlap ratios, and any `validation_failures`, so Ops can spot retries or seam duplication even when DOM warnings don’t fire. Ensure the log rotation/search tooling ingests the new keys.
* Prometheus scraping now covers capture/OCR/stitch latencies, warning/blocklist totals, SSE heartbeats, and job completions. Scrape `/metrics` directly or hit the exporter bound to `PROMETHEUS_PORT` when you need a dedicated port.
* Persistent Chromium profiles live under `CACHE_ROOT/profiles/<id>/storage_state.json`. The UI dropdown and CLI `--profile` flag reuse these directories, and manifests/RunRecords echo `profile_id` so audits can trace which persona captured a run.
* OCR manifests now include `ocr_autotune` (initial/final/peak concurrency plus the most recent adjustments). The CLI + UI render this block so operators know when the controller scaled up/down; set `OCR_MIN_CONCURRENCY`/`OCR_MAX_CONCURRENCY` to shape the window and override via env when debugging throttling.
