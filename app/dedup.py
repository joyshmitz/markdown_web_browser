"""Tile overlap deduplication using multi-tier matching strategy.

This module implements a research-backed approach to removing duplicate content
from overlapping OCR tiles, based on Google's text stitching patents and proven
diff algorithms.

Multi-tier strategy:
1. Pixel-level overlap detection (SHA256 hashes)
2. Exact line matching (O(n) - fast path)
3. Sequence matching (O(n*m) - difflib.SequenceMatcher)
4. Fuzzy line-by-line matching (O(n*c) - fallback)

    Remove duplicate content from overlapping tiles using multi-tier strategy.

    This function implements a conservative, research-backed approach:
    1. Only deduplicates when pixel-level overlap is confirmed
    2. Tries exact matching first (fast path)
    3. Falls back to sequence matching for OCR variations
    4. Finally tries fuzzy line-by-line matching
    5. Never removes more than 3x estimated overlap (safety)
