bd-co1 JobManager/SSE review — fixed `app/main.py` to import `summarize_dom_assists` from warning_log and emit DOM-assist events even when manifests only include `dom_assist_summary`, ensured the fallback summarizer passes `tiles_total` so SSE/warning log metrics retain assist density + ratios when recomputed, taught `mdwb resume status` to call out orphan done_flags (JSON + CLI warning) while copying them into `done_flags_review/` for audit, added CLI event-stream regression tests that force `_watch_events_with_fallback` down the SSE path, and fixed `mdwb watch --raw` so `--on` hooks still fire (with tests).
bd-7sx Prometheus metrics instrumentation — instrumentation + docs done; waiting on Grafana scrape to validate queries/alerts once data flows.
bd-bb4 Prom metrics health smoke — scripts/check_metrics.py + tests shipped and bead closed; docs/PLAN updated.
Next bead standby: monitoring Prom scrape rollout to confirm dashboards/alerts consume mdwb_* metrics; ready to pick up tkq slice once telemetry consumers give the green light.
bd-4zy Ops script pytest coverage — 2025-11-09 GreenLake hardened `scripts/show_latest_smoke.py` (blank `latest.txt` now fails fast), expanded pytest coverage (pointer/seam-marker cases + weekly JSON), taught `scripts/check_metrics.py --check-weekly --json` to always emit a `weekly` block, updated README/docs/ops/PLAN, and ran `SKIP_LIBVIPS_CHECK=1 bash scripts/run_checks.sh`.
bd-ptest-cli Stream, demo, SSE helpers, fetch hook guards, diag manifest fallbacks, and warnings CLI missing-log handling are under pytest (`tests/test_mdwb_cli_events.py` covers `_iter_sse` + `_stream_job`; `tests/test_mdwb_cli_fetch.py` checks `--on` validation + hook passing; `tests/test_mdwb_cli_diag.py` verifies manifest-error reporting; `tests/test_mdwb_cli_warnings.py` now covers the missing-log path; `tests/test_mdwb_cli_show.py` covers demo snapshot/links). Targeted CLI subset, ruff --fix, and uvx ty check all pass. Next up: audit remaining CLI helpers for redundant stubs + ensure run_checks.sh stays in sync.
bd-ptest-reporting run_checks now writes JUnit + JSON summaries (`tmp/pytest_report.xml`, `tmp/pytest_summary.json`) via scripts/report_pytest_summary.py, and the new unit tests (`tests/test_report_pytest_summary.py`) keep the parser honest; documentation updates pending once README/docs/ops reservations clear.
bd-ptest-prom Store/persistence + Prom health tests wired into run_checks: `tests/test_store_manifest.py`, `tests/test_manifest_contract.py`, and `tests/test_check_metrics.py` guard RunRecord metadata + CLI exporter overrides, with README/docs/ops/PLAN noting the coverage.
bd-ptest-ops run_checks now bundles the smoke pointer tests (`tests/test_show_latest_smoke.py`, `tests/test_update_smoke_pointers.py`) plus the Prom/store suites, dedupes the e2e hook, and documents the expanded matrix so ops know the exact test set.
bd-0o0 Playwright config + transport fallback — `playwright.config.mjs` now defaults to CfT (`PLAYWRIGHT_CHANNEL=cft`) and accepts comma-separated channel/transport preferences; README/docs/ops/config spell out the env knobs and fallback guidance so CLI smoke runs match the capture settings.
bd-0o0 Playwright config + transport fallback — tracking the shared Playwright config + CDP/BiDi switch so §§3/19 align with AGENTS.
bd-9ke Implement /replay API — FastAPI now exposes POST /replay (ReplayRequest schema, JobManager.replay_job, event logging, tests/test_api_replay.py).
bd-cls Profile_id passthrough & persistent contexts — done: JobManager/store now persist profile ids, manifests/RunRecord echo them, CLI/SSE surface them, and profiles reuse `.cache/profiles/<id>/storage_state.json`.
bd-2p3 Links tab actions + DOM/OCR deltas — DONE (RedDog 2025-11-09): LinkRecord now records rel/target/kind/domain + Markdown, Links tab groups rows per domain with coverage/attribute badges, open-job/copy/crawled actions (local persistence), README/PLAN updated, ruff/ty/pytest green.
bd-4wx Adopt HTMX SSE extension — DONE: UI root now uses `hx-ext="sse" sse-connect`, JS listens to `htmx:sse*` events (state/progress/manifest + dom_assist summaries), the legacy EventSource shim was removed, and docs/PLAN note the change.
bd-x6v Content-addressed cache reuse — DONE: `/jobs` now hashes (url + CfT + viewport + DSF + OCR model + profile), stores cache keys in SQLite/manifests, surfaces `cache_hit` in API/SSE/CLI, and adds `mdwb fetch --cache/--no-cache`.
bd-hki Generative E2E guardrail tests — IN FLIGHT (PurpleBear 2025-11-09): FlowLogger upgrades + diff snippets now in `tests/test_e2e_generated.py`, README/docs mention `MDWB_RUN_E2E_GENERATED`/`MDWB_GENERATED_E2E_CASES`; follow-up to add more real-world cases.
bd-l9n Granian runtime toggle + docs — DONE (RedDog 2025-11-09): `scripts/run_server.py` + `SERVER_IMPL` env toggle, manifests/RunRecord now record `environment.server_runtime`, docs (README/config/ops/PLAN) updated, and tests cover uvicorn/granian launcher paths.
bd-e0q Release + regression checklist docs — DONE (RedDog 2025-11-09): `docs/release_checklist.md` details config capture → test matrix → artifacts/sign-off, linked from README/PLAN so §20.3 now references a concrete runbook.
bd-dex Agent starter docs/tests reaffirmed the `--out` pathways (README + PLAN lines added); awaiting further requirements before touching code again.
bd-b9e DOM-guided heading leveling & provenance viewer — DONE (RedDog 2025-11-09): seam markers + enriched provenance comments, smarter duplicate table-header trimming (overlap-aware similarity), and CLI/UI hooks now surface the extra breadcrumbs. 2025-11-09 — PinkCastle auditing the new stitch/provenance paths + docs/tests for regressions per bd-b9e follow-up; list/blockquote prefixes now survive DOM assists, overlay queues handle duplicate headings, and warning log tables fold long seam/sweep summaries without losing ratio text.
bd-805 Hybrid text recovery heuristics — DOM low-confidence detectors (replacement-char, punctuation bursts, mixed numeric, hyphen-break) now drive DOM overlays in `stitch_markdown`, manifest `dom_assists`, SSE/NDJSON events, CLI diag/watch tables, and the `/jobs/{id}/artifact/highlight` helper. 2025-11-09 — PinkCastle added spaced-letter + code-fence guards plus the dom_assist summary surfaced through manifest/SSE/CLI/UI (manifest tab shows counts/reasons live) with density/ratio metrics and Prometheus export (`mdwb_dom_assist_density`, `mdwb_dom_assist_reason_ratio{reason=…}`) so ops/dashboards can alert on hybrid recovery spikes.
bd-90m OCR concurrency autotune & HTTP/2 tuning — DONE (RedDog 2025-11-09): adaptive limiter in `app/ocr_client.py`, manifest/SSE/CLI surfacing (`ocr_autotune`), UI + docs updates, and regression tests ensure scaling decisions + telemetry stay stable.
bd-rle Rich CLI E2E logging scaffolding — DONE (PurpleBear 2025-11-09): FlowLogger v2 + transcript exporter + the `mdwb fetch --resume --webhook` scenario now live in `tests/test_e2e_cli.py` (panels/tables/progress + artifact logs).
bd-rlc Agent + warnings integration coverage — DONE (PurpleBear 2025-11-09): `tests/test_e2e_cli.py` now covers `agents summarize` + `agents generate-todos` with transcript exports plus the combined `mdwb warnings tail --json` → `mdwb diag --json` flow, asserting on `rich` Panels/Tables/Progress + artifact paths.
bd-rlp Run-checks toggle + docs updates — DONE (PurpleBear 2025-11-09): `scripts/run_checks.sh` now supports `MDWB_RUN_E2E_RICH` (copying FlowLogger transcripts into `tmp/rich_e2e_cli/` via `RICH_E2E_ARTIFACT_DIR`), and README/docs/PLAN call out the new toggle alongside the lighter `MDWB_RUN_E2E`.
bd-692 Viewport seam watermark hints — open to inject invisible viewport markers and stitcher logic per PLAN §15.
bd-we4 Semantic post-processing toggle — open to design the optional LLM/post-processing stage with provenance + config hooks per PLAN §15.
bd-n5c Depth-1 crawl mode — open to build the allowlisted single-hop crawl orchestration in PLAN §15.
bd-md3 Capture/OCR SLO dashboards — open to automate the §20.1 SLO/error-budget calculations and dashboards. 2025-11-09 update: PinkHill documented the seam marker telemetry workflow (README/docs/ops) so weekly seam count/hash percentiles can feed Grafana/Prom alerts alongside capture/OCR SLOs; next step is wiring the exporters to publish those values directly.
bd-0jc Overlap & hyphenation guard research — open to run the PLAN §17 experiments on overlap windows + hyphen guards and feed new defaults/tests.
