PLAN §22 note landed (2025-11-08, bd-h2m/3pr/a2e):
- scripts/show_latest_smoke.py now documents `--manifest --metrics --weekly --limit 5 --json` plus `MDWB_SMOKE_ROOT/--root`, and the new `check` command for CI health.
- Status line included: `_2025-11-08 — BlueHill (bd-h2m/3pr/a2e) added the weekly view + MDWB_SMOKE_ROOT/--root override, JSON output, and check command so ops can inspect or validate summary/manifest/weekly data from one CLI invocation._`

2025-11-08 — GreenMountain (bd-x6v) starting content-addressed cache reuse

Starting bd-x6v cache reuse work now - GreenMountain
2025-11-08 — ChartreuseCastle (bd-0o0) aligned the shared Playwright config with the CfT defaults (channel `cft` + optional comma-separated fallbacks) and documented the transport/channel env semantics in README/docs/ops/config so PLAN §§3.1–3.4 match AGENTS.

2025-11-09 — GreenMountain (bd-hki) added fixtures + MDWB_RUN_E2E_GENERATED toggle for generative E2E tests

2025-11-09 — GreenMountain continued bd-hki generative guardrail work

2025-11-09 — GreenMountain added generative guardrail fixtures/tests (bd-hki)

2025-11-09 — GreenMountain (bd-90m) starting OCR concurrency autotune + HTTP/2 tuning

2025-11-09 — RedDog (bd-2p3) delivered LinkRecord metadata + domain-grouped Links tab (coverage/attribute badges, open job/copy/crawled actions) with local crawl tracking and README/PLAN updates.

2025-11-09 — RedDog (bd-l9n) added scripts/run_server.py + SERVER_IMPL/Granian docs, recorded server_runtime in manifests/DB, and updated ops/config/README.

2025-11-09 — RedDog (bd-90m) shipped OCR concurrency autotune (controller, manifest/SSE/CLI/UI updates + tests).

2025-11-09 — RedDog (bd-e0q) published docs/release_checklist.md and linked it from README/PLAN for the release/regression workflow.

2025-11-09 — RedDog (bd-b9e) added seam markers, stricter table header trimming, and richer provenance comments per PLAN §19.4.

2025-11-09 — GreenMountain resumed bd-90m OCR concurrency autotune work

2025-11-09 — RedDog (bd-692) shipped viewport seam watermarks (CSS overlays + seam hashes in tiles/manifests/stitcher).

2025-11-09 — PinkCastle (bd-b9e follow-up) audited the stitcher DOM assist/table trim paths: fixed hyphen-break overlays to merge multi-line headings, taught table trimming to skip blank/comment prologues, and added regression tests + run_checks/ruff/ty.

2025-11-09 — PinkCastle (bd-b9e follow-up) tightened DOM overlay handling again: list/blockquote prefixes are preserved, overlay candidates are consumed in FIFO order so duplicate headings don’t reuse stale DOM text, and the warnings CLI table now folds overly long cells (plus the sweep summary prints both the precise overlap ratio and a truncated variant so the existing smoke tests still see `ratio=0.9`).
2025-11-09 — PinkCastle (bd-805) wired the new dom_assist summaries end-to-end: manifests/SSE expose reason counts + samples, the CLI renders the aggregated tables, and the UI manifest tab now shows assist totals with live updates when SSE dom_assist events arrive.
2025-11-09 — PurpleBear picked up bd-hki (generative E2E guardrail tests) to review PLAN §14 requirements, outline the generated scenario harness, and prep the remaining fixtures/docs before coding.
2025-11-09 — PurpleBear (bd-hki) upgraded `tests/test_e2e_generated.py` with FlowLogger output, diff snippets, and README/docs toggle notes so the generative guardrail suite is actionable whenever `MDWB_RUN_E2E_GENERATED=1` is set (override cases via `MDWB_GENERATED_E2E_CASES`).
2025-11-09 — RedMountain (markdown_web_browser-co1) audited DOM-assist surfacing: `app/main.py` now imports `summarize_dom_assists` from `app.warning_log` and the SSE snapshot builder falls back to `manifest.dom_assist_summary`, so cached/replayed runs still emit dom_assist events even when the raw `dom_assists` list is absent.
